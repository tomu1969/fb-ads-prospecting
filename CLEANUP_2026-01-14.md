# Repository Cleanup - January 14, 2026

Comprehensive cleanup and archival performed by Hygiene Master agent.

## Summary

This cleanup focused on organizing accumulated campaign files, removing duplicates, and archiving superseded files while preserving all active experiment artifacts.

## Changes Made

### 1. Config Folder Cleanup

**Archived to `config/legacy/`:**
- `bounced_contacts_2.csv` (15 contacts, intermediate)
- `bounced_contacts_3.csv` (4 contacts, early snapshot)

**Active:** `bounced_contacts.csv` (68 contacts, actively used by exp_001)

### 2. Input Folder Cleanup

**Archived to `input/legacy/`:**
- `fb_ads_scraped_20260105_143549.csv` (early Jan 5 scrape)

- `hubspot_leads.csv` (CRM export, large file)
- `top_real_estate_agents_socials.csv` (most recent, Jan 13)

### 3. Processed Folder Cleanup

**Archived to `processed/legacy/`:**
- `03d_final_backup.csv` (backup file)
- `needs_draft_recovered.csv` (intermediate file)
- `*_validation_report.txt` (4 validation reports)

**Retained:** All current pipeline intermediates and symlinks

### 4. Output/Email Campaign Cleanup

**Archived to `output/email_campaign/legacy/`:**

**Duplicates (5 files):**
- `drafts_20260113_110425_fixed.csv`
- `drafts_20260113_110432_fixed.csv`
- `drafts_batch2_fixed.csv` (superseded by _v2)
- `drafts_recovered_v2.csv` (superseded)

**Verification Reports (5 files):**
- All timestamped verification reports
- Intermediate quality check outputs

**Intermediate Files (4 files):**
- `recovered_contacts.csv` (superseded by recovered_batch2.csv)
- `resend_2_drafts.csv`, `resend_input.csv`, `to_draft_batch2.csv`

**Total archived:** 13 files

**Active files preserved:** 17 files (all referenced in exp_001 state.json)

### 5. Code Updates

**File:** `scripts/loader.py`
- **Change:** Updated `load_fb_ads_format()` path from `scripts/legacy/` to `scripts/_archived/`
- **Reason:** Align with actual archive folder structure
- **Impact:** Fixes broken import for FB Ads format loading

### 6. Documentation Updates

**CLAUDE.md:**
- Added `config/legacy/` folder
- Added `input/legacy/` folder
- Added `email_campaign/legacy/` subfolder

**README.md:**
- Fixed duplicate config/ section
- Added all new legacy folder locations
- Updated project structure to match actual state

**Legacy READMEs created:**
- `config/legacy/README.md` - Documents archived config files
- `input/legacy/README.md` - Documents archived input files
- `output/email_campaign/legacy/README.md` - Documents archived campaign files

## Files Protected (NOT Archived)

All files actively referenced in `experiments/active/exp_001_q1_email_sequence/state.json`:
- Batch 1-4 draft files (originals and fixed versions)
- All resend and recovery files
- Follow-up email files
- Campaign tracking logs
- Excluded contacts lists

## Impact

- **Config:** Reduced from 12 to 10 files (2 archived)
- **Input:** Reduced from 9 to 4 files (4 archived)
- **Processed:** Reduced from 18 to 13 files (5 archived)
- **Email Campaign:** Reduced from 30 to 17 files (13 archived)

**Total:** 24 files archived, 0 deleted (all preserved in legacy folders)

## Git Status

Changes committed:
- Config: `git mv` for 2 bounced_contacts files
- Code: Updated loader.py import path
- Docs: Updated CLAUDE.md and README.md
- Legacy READMEs: Created in 3 locations

Changes NOT in git (output/ and processed/ are gitignored):
- Input, processed, and output folder file moves
- These files can be restored from filesystem backups if needed

## Recovery Instructions

All archived files can be easily restored:

```bash
# Restore a config file
git mv config/legacy/[filename] config/[filename]

# Restore an input file
cp input/legacy/[filename] input/[filename]

# Restore an email campaign file
cp output/email_campaign/legacy/[filename] output/email_campaign/[filename]
```

## Verification

- No orphaned imports found (verified via grep)
- All exp_001 artifacts preserved and accessible
- Fixed broken loader.py import path
- Documentation updated to reflect current structure

## Next Steps

1. Monitor next pipeline run to verify loader.py fix works
2. Consider archiving `output/legacy/` files older than 30 days
3. Consider archiving `processed/legacy/` files older than 30 days
4. Run experiment cleanup if exp_001 completes

"HomesUSA.com, Inc.",David Klein,david@homesusa.com,"Quick idea for HomesUSA.com, Inc.","Hi David,

I noticed on your website that HomesUSA.com uses the SpecDeck platform to help 70+ Texas homebuilders reduce Days on Market by 14-40 days.

With that volume of builder clients and AI-powered MLS management, response speed on incoming leads becomes even more critical.

Most FB/IG leads go cold because they don't get a response fast enough. We help fix that with instant responses and automated follow-up. Worth a quick look?

That foundation clearly paid off. Now running your own book at ONE Sotheby's in Fort Lauderdale, you know better than anyone that leads need immediate attention.

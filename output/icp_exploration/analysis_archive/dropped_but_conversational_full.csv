I'd waited eight hours outside city hall that day, clutching useless queue tickets, my heart cracking a little more with every passing minute. Aaron Galloway—the man who'd promised me forever—was supposed to show up to get our marriage license. But he never did. For the third time, he'd chosen her. His fragile, depressed ""old flame"" Patti, the one he could never say no to.
I wasn't going to cry anymore. I wasn't going to beg. So I pulled out my phone and dialed the number I'd ignored twice before: Fredrick Pollard, Aaron's biggest business rival and the man who'd proposed to me every single time Aaron stood me up.
""I agree to marry you,"" I said, voice steady for the first time in years.
Fredrick didn't gloat. He just said he'd be back from his trip in a week and if I still meant it, we'd meet at city hall. No pressure. No games. Just a chance.
That week, I erased Aaron from my life. I boxed up every photo, every couple's mug, every memory we'd built in the apartment he'd connected to mine. I called a real estate agent and listed it for sale—price didn't matter, I just wanted it gone. Wanted every trace of him gone.
Of course, Aaron came home that night with Patti clinging to his arm like a damsel in distress. He didn't even apologize for ditching me. He just announced she was staying with us because her ""depression flared up."" Then he ordered me to prepare the guest room for her.
I watched him give Patti his own bedroom while he crawled into mine hours later, wrapping his arms around me like nothing had happened. ""Sorry I flaked,"" he murmured against my neck. ""Patti needed me. Let's postpone the license until she's better. Be patient, okay? I'll make it up to you.""

Chapter 1 Like Mother, Like Daughter
It was September in Dasmieca. In the fancy Jennings family mansion in Shoneport, five people sat in the living room, the tension thick enough to choke on.

Briar Jennings, fresh off a flight from abroad, kicked back on a couch, legs crossed like she owned the place. The other four were crammed together on the other couch across from her, clearly uncomfortable.

Gunfire from a phone game kept blasting from Briar's phone, cutting through her father's voice every time he tried to speak.

""Briar, you just got back. You don't even know the first thing about running a company,"" Edgar Jennings said. ""Why don't you hand your shares over to me? You'll still get your annual cut just like before.""

Briar didn't even glance up. Her thumbs kept tapping.

Edgar continued, ""Your brother's grown now. It's time he started learning the ropes. I could transfer him half your shares so that he doesn't have to start from scratch.""

There was still nothing from Briar.

""And about that engagement to the Hargreaves boy,"" Edgar added. ""You've been gone for years. You don't even know him anymore. Why not let your sister take your place?""

No matter what he said, Briar just kept playing, like he wasn't even there.

Edgar's patience wore thin. His face darkened, but before he could explode, Halle Jennings—his ever-graceful wife and longtime expert at playing the good stepmother—gently placed a hand on his chest.

""Edgar, she just got home,"" she said sweetly. ""Let her settle in first.""

But her eyes weren't so sweet. They flicked coldl | “Tell Sara to wake her up for breakfast,” Edgar said with a scoff.
“She’s not getting into Shoneport University anyway.”

“She’s been up since six,” the maid replied.
“Just got back from her morning run.”

The family turned—and saw Briar standing in the doorway.
Calm. Cold. Unbothered.
“Don’t worry,” she said, eyes gleaming.
“I don’t eat with trash. It ruins my appetite.”
Then she walked upstairs like they didn’t exist.

Today was the day she and Carter Harris were finally getting their marriage licenses.

From their college romance to their engagement, and now, getting their marriage licenses, it had been exactly five years.

Whitney leaned back in the seat, the morning sunlight casting a warm glow on her radiant face, giving her an extra touch of gentleness.

The driver caught her smile in the rearview mirror and joked, ""Wow, you just landed, and you're already rushing straight to City Hall?""

""Yeah, Valentine's Day. You know, I made the appointment two weeks ago,"" Whitney replied with a smile.

The driver chuckled. ""Young folks really know how to make things special. My daughter couldn't snag a spot for today, so she's getting hers tomorrow instead.""

""Congrats,"" Whitney said.

""Same to you,"" the driver replied.

But even after Whitney got out of the cab, she still hadn't heard back from Carter.

Pouting, she dialed his number.

The phone rang for ages before he finally picked up.

Carter's voice was flat, giving nothing away. ""Yeah? What's up?""

Whitney's grip tightened on her phone as she asked, ""Carter, where are you? I'm already at City Hall. We will—""

Carter cut her off. ""Whit, I can't come right now.""

She swallowed hard. ""What happened? Didn't we agree to get our marriage license today?""

""Yeah, something came up. Let's just do it another day, okay? Any day works. It's not a big deal,"" Carter said.

Yet to Whitney, it was a big deal. She had made the appointment two weeks ago and had been expecting this very day ever since.

A girl's voice rang out. ""Carter, are you on the phone? Everyone's waiting downstairs for us to join them for breakfast.""

Whitney's heart dropped. That was Emily's voice.

Emily Miller was the girl whom the Harris family adopted eighteen years ago. Whitney wondered, 'Is Emily back to the country?'

I'd waited eight hours outside city hall that day, clutching useless queue tickets, my heart cracking a little more with every passing minute. Aaron Galloway—the man who'd promised me forever—was supposed to show up to get our marriage license. But he never did. For the third time, he'd chosen her. His fragile, depressed ""old flame"" Patti, the one he could never say no to.
I wasn't going to cry anymore. I wasn't going to beg. So I pulled out my phone and dialed the number I'd ignored twice before: Fredrick Pollard, Aaron's biggest business rival and the man who'd proposed to me every single time Aaron stood me up.
""I agree to marry you,"" I said, voice steady for the first time in years.
Fredrick didn't gloat. He just said he'd be back from his trip in a week and if I still meant it, we'd meet at city hall. No pressure. No games. Just a chance.
That week, I erased Aaron from my life. I boxed up every photo, every couple's mug, every memory we'd built in the apartment he'd connected to mine. I called a real estate agent and listed it for sale—price didn't matter, I just wanted it gone. Wanted every trace of him gone.
Of course, Aaron came home that night with Patti clinging to his arm like a damsel in distress. He didn't even apologize for ditching me. He just announced she was staying with us because her ""depression flared up."" Then he ordered me to prepare the guest room for her.
I watched him give Patti his own bedroom while he crawled into mine hours later, wrapping his arms around me like nothing had happened. ""Sorry I flaked,"" he murmured against my neck. ""Patti needed me. Let's postpone the license until she's better. Be patient, okay? I'll make it up to you.""

The next morning, Pa | Chapter 1: The Wolfless Omega
Addison 
As I approached the main gates of Blackbolt High, a highschool meant for werewolves, I could already pick up several conversations all around me. It wasn't the first time I had heard most of the chatter, but on that morning, there seemed to be more enthusiasm and I wondered why. Even as I looked around, everyone seemed so hyped.
With my sense of hearing so powerful, it was difficult to focus on a particular conversation.
As soon as I stepped through the front doors, the sound of chatter and lockers slamming was much louder. 
With my head low, I made my way down the crowded hallway so I could get to my locker. I didn't bother to look up as I was certain all I would see would be the mockery on people's faces, just because I was a wolfless Omega, or at least, that was what everyone believed. However, they were absolutely wrong about me.

It’s not sexy or high tech, but it’s *wildly* profitable.

Most people bust their butts working 8+ hours a day for a paycheck that feels like pennies.

But that’s only because they don’t know there’s a better way. 

Or because they think making money online is too hard, too risky, or that it takes too much time.

Thank goodness that’s not true.

Turns out there’s a way to make a great side income online—or even replace a 9-to-5 job—WITHOUT tech skills, business experience, or big risks…

And WITHOUT creating new products, using new tech like A.I., or even working full-time hours.

Here’s proof:

💰 Jim has done $1 million in this business

💰 Andrew has done $1 million

💰 Leopold has done $400,000

💰 Seth has done $3.6 million

💰 Randy has done $5 million

💰 Kathy has done $1 million

… and the list goes on and on and on.

Now, of course we can't guarantee you're gonna get these kinds of results. They certainly aren't typical.

I mean, these people worked really hard and did a fantastic job.

But results like those are absolutely *possible.*

So, how did Jim, Kathy, and the rest of them do it?

The answer is NOT something super sexy, modern, or cutting edge. And it has nothing to do with A.I.

It’s actually kind of boring.

They did it by flipping books.

Yep, that’s right. Used, physical books.

And no, they’re not writing these books. They’re not reading these books. They’re not *paying* somebody to write these books. And they’re not doing audiobooks or e-books or any of that.

They’re just flipping boring old physical books.

In the firewood shed.

A girl, around fifteen or sixteen, curled up tightly, her body shaking uncontrollably as if trapped in a horrifying nightmare.

Her pale pink jacket was filthy beyond recognition.

The butterfly hairpin had long fallen off, and her tangled hair was covered in mud.

After struggling in the pile of firewood for a while, she suddenly jolted awake with a hoarse scream, ""It wasn't me! I swear it wasn't me!""

Her voice trailed off, and as she took in her surroundings, the terror in her eyes gradually gave way to confusion.

Hadn't she died?

Her eldest brother Joshua Wallen had cut out her tongue, her second brother Avery Wallen poisoned her, her fifth brother Andrew had severed her legs, her fourth brother Clyde had kicked her out, and she had taken a sword for Tessa.

In the end, her third brother Russell had tossed her body into the cold pond…

Why was she back in the firewood shed in the Chancellor's estate?

In her previous life, she had been locked up here for a full month, leaving her with severe rheumatism that tormented her for three long years.

She hadn't expected to be reborn.

As reality hit her, Margaery Wallen's pale face twisted into a bitter smile.

She was the daughter of the Chancellor's estate. Her mother had died during a difficult childbirth, and the midwife told her father Raul Wallen that only she had survived.

Being a preemie, weak and frail, and her mother's last memory, she became the family's prized possession.

That week, I erased Aaron from my life. I boxed up every photo, every couple's mug, every memory we'd built in the apartment he'd connected to mine. I called a real estate agent and listed it for sale—price didn't matter, I just wanted it gone. Wanted every trace of him gone.
Of course, Aaron came home that night with Patti clinging to his arm like a damsel in distress. He didn't even apologize for ditching me. He just announced she was staying with us because her ""depression flared up."" Then he ordered me to prepare the guest room for her.

Great guy. Ton of years in the game. Solid book of business. Clients love him.

But he was stuck.

Same AUM. Same revenue. Same ceiling he'd been smacking his head against for years.

And look... it's not like he wasn't trying.

He'd spent money on marketing before. Agencies. Ads. The whole thing.

Problem was... all that money went into THEIR pockets. Not his brand. Not his business.

Just... poof. Gone.

Here's the thing...

David wasn't bad at his job. Dude was actually brilliant at it.

His problem? He didn't have a client acquisition SYSTEM. A funnel that worked for HIM, building HIS brand, attracting HIS ideal clients.

So we built him one.

Not a cookie-cutter template. A custom funnel designed around his expertise, his market, his ideal client.

And here's what's different about how we work:

Every dollar he spends on ads? Builds HIS brand. Not ours. He keeps the asset.

And we only make money on the upside we add.

Read that again.

We're not an agency that charges whether it works or not. We're a performance partner. We only win when YOU win.

Fast forward 6 months.

$5M+ in net new AUM.

Not from cold calling. Not from begging for referrals. From a funnel that brings qualified prospects to him on autopilot.

Wild, right?

We've done this with 28+ advisors now. Helped firms anywhere between $30M to $1.2B in managed assets.

Or, hey... you could keep paying agencies that charge you whether you get clients or not.

You know - throwing money into the void, hoping something sticks, watching your ""brand"" get built on rented land.

If it floats ya boat.

Anyhoo. I put together a short video breaking down exactly how this works.

No fluff. No 47-minute webinar. Just the system.

Watch. Click. Then scale. 🚀

My name is Dr. Vanessa Doucet.

I'm a board-certified dermatologist with 32 years of clinical experience, published research in the Journal of Dermatological Science, and I've treated more than 1,200 Black women suffering from chronic hair loss and thinning hairlines.

And for three decades, I prescribed Minoxidil for edge loss.

Every single week.

To women who came into my office with see-through temples, disappearing hairlines, and edges that had been gone for months or years.

I wrote the prescription with complete confidence.

Because Minoxidil is FDA-approved.

Because it's the gold standard.

Because that's what medical school taught me to do.

But here's what I never told those women, because I didn't know it myself until four years ago.

The FDA never approved Minoxidil to reverse edge loss.

Not in Black women.

Not for traction alopecia.

Not for chemical damage.

Not for the inflammation-driven follicle miniaturization that causes 87% of chronic edge loss cases in women over 50.

The FDA approved Minoxidil in 1988 for one thing and one thing only.

To slow the progression of hereditary hair loss.

Not to reverse it.

Not to regrow what's already gone.

Not to reactivate miniaturized follicles at the temples and edges.

To slow it down.

And for 37 years, dermatologists like me have been prescribing it off-label for edge loss anyway.

Knowing the FDA approval doesn't cover what you actually need.

Knowing the clinical trials never tested it on Black women with traction alopecia.

Knowing it was designed to maintain existing hair, not bring back what you've already lost.

I know what you're thinking right now.

""If this is true, why didn't my dermatologist tell me?""

Because most of us never read the actual FDA approval documents.

I woke up chained to a hospital bed, discovered my billionaire husband had sold me to a black-market organ harvester, watched the surgeon prep his scalpel—and then I heard my husband laughing on the phone in the hallway, telling his mistress he'd finally found a way to get rid of me without paying a dime in divorce settlements.

The surgical lamp burned white above me.

I couldn't move—my wrists and ankles were strapped down with leather restraints that bit into my skin every time I struggled.

""Don't waste your energy."" The surgeon didn't even look at me. He was arranging his tools on a metal tray. Scalpels. Clamps. A bone saw. ""Your husband paid extra for us to keep you conscious. Said he wanted you to feel everything.""

My throat was so dry I could barely speak.

""There must be some mistake. My husband is Dominic Ashford. He's—""

""One of the richest men in the country. Yes, I know."" The surgeon finally met my eyes, and there was nothing human in his gaze. ""That's why your organs are worth so much. Clean living. Private doctors. No drugs, no alcohol. You're practically a medical-grade specimen.""

I heard Dominic's voice getting closer.

""Yes, baby, I'll be home for dinner. The procedure should only take a few hours.""

He appeared in the doorway, phone pressed to his ear, looking at me the way someone looks at a piece of furniture they're about to throw away.

We'd been married for three years.

Three years of me believing I was living a fairytale—the ordinary girl who caught the eye of the untouchable billionaire.

Now I understood.

I was never the princess in this story.

I was the sacrifice.

""Dominic,"" I whispered. ""Please. Whatever I did wrong, I can fix it. Just tell me what I did.""

He ended his call and walked toward me, adjusting his cufflinks like he was heading to a business meeting instead of my execution.

""You didn't do anything wrong, sweetheart. That's the problem | I was about to hide the gift I'd prepared for our fifth anniversary in the wall of his armory when I accidentally opened a hidden safe I never knew existed.
Inside, there were no documents or gold bars—just a bullet necklace engraved with hotel room numbers, and a diary filled with my husband's obsession for another woman.
I was still holding the custom gun I'd made for him, the grips inlaid with our initials and our date. The metal was ice-cold, but just minutes ago when I'd held it, my palms had been sweating, my heart fluttering with an almost childish anticipation.

My fingers traced the cold bullets, each one engraved with clear lettering.

Night before proposal. That night, he'd come home very late, smelling of unfamiliar perfume.
He said it was business. I believed him. I'd even prepared hangover soup for him.
I grabbed the leather-bound diary and flipped through it quickly.
Adrian's handwriting was sharp, filled with romantic words I'd never heard, but they weren't meant for me—they were for Olivia.
""Keira handled the dock situation perfectly today. Clean and efficient. Olivia said now she can focus on preparing for next week's art exhibition without worrying about that dirty business tarnishing her reputation. My Olivia, she only needs to live in the sunlight. Keira is the perfect shield.""

A low, intimate laugh came from Derek's locked office.
I froze, an earring slipping from my finger. The sound came from his private office, the one even the cleaning staff locked.

""Charlie doesn't understand me the way you do.""
I heard Derek's gentle, intimate voice when I was only three feet from the door.
Then it was her.
Vivian Clarke. 
His VP of Marketing.
Wearing the dress I'd complimented hours earlier—sitting on his desk, his hand on her waist, intimately.
I didn't gasp. Instead, I stood there for a full three seconds, with a shock-stricken calm, meticulously recording every detail.

Then I closed the door. Carefully, silently. So quietly that they didn't even notice.
He's a hero in their eyes. A visionary. A godda-mn saint.

The diamonds feel heavier coming off than they did going on.
I stand in front of the bathroom mirror, fingers working the clasp of the Cartier necklace Derrick gave me for our fifth anniversary. The woman staring back at me looks like she belongs in a magazine spread sleek updo, perfect makeup, designer gown that probably cost more than most people's monthly mortgage. But her eyes are tired. No, not tired. Empty.
I finally get the necklace undone and set it on the marble counter with a soft clink. The sound echoes in the cavernous bathroom, all gleaming fixtures and heated floors. This penthouse has everything. Everything except the one thing I actually need a husband who looks at me like I matter.

Oh sh-it.
I sat frozen in my place. My 17-year-old but, which has seen better, and worse days was numb from not moving for a few hours so I couldn't have been sure whether someone stitched it to the uncomfortable leather seat. It would explain my lack of movement, right?

I subconsciously touched my belly, and still couldn't believe a pup was lying there. Had I heard it right? I was pregnant? I was pregnant with a pup for Nathan! After three years as his Luna, I'm finally carrying the pup who would be my mate's heir,the future of the Nightfall Pack.

""Sylvia,"" I whispered to my wolf , ""we're going to be mothers.""

My wolf stirred within me, her presence warm and protective.

On the way out of the hospital, I couldn't wait to tell Nathan about our pup. I wondered what his reaction would be. Would he howl in happiness? Would he kiss me and all?Goddess, I could barely contain myself.

I cupped my red face as I fantasized. But the moment I felt the cold from the simple ring on my finger, my wildly beating heart calmed down. I almost forgot that Nathan wasn't the type to be keen on having pups, especially when our marriage was arranged by our family.

Our families have been friends for a long time ago.So our marriage also strengthen the alliance between the Nightfall Pack and the Raven shadow Pack.

Nathan was a complete gentleman, both as a friend and a mate. Every time we had sex, he was considerate but cautious—cautious not to claim me with his mark. No claiming bite, no permanent tie.

He said there was no need to add extra shackles when we were not ready.

This pup in a way, was out of plan.

My mind was becoming restless as I sat in my car. Would this be good news for him?

""You're spiraling,"" Sylvia murmured in my mind. ""Stop overthinking. He's your mate. He'll be happy.""

""Luna Kyra, is everything okay? Should I send a mind-link to the Alpha Nathan?""  | Was it a blessing to marry your best friend?

I was not very sure what Nathan thought. But for me, becoming his chosen mate was a dream come true. And now—what was even more miraculous—we were going to have our first pup.

Three days before the wedding, I went to try on my gown. It was a white dress with an elaborate design with lots of laces and tulle on the skirt. As the seamstress pinned the sides and adjusted the length, I looked in the mirror and felt excited. I wanted to show it to Craig, and see his face light up when he saw it. There was nothing I didn’t share with him.

Lucy, my stepmother, looked me over and smiled thinly. “You look good, Bella,” she said quietly.

“Thanks mom!” I replied. “Can I show this to Craig?”

She shook her head. “No, we follow the rules. It's a bad omen for the bride and groom to meet so close to the wedding.”

“Please mom,” I whined. “I won’t show it on me. Just the dress in the box. He’ll be so happy. It’s only bad to meet the day before,” I added. “Not three days before.”

“It’s bad,” she said firmly. “You will see him at the rehearsal dinner tomorrow with everyone. And that’s it!”

I didn’t want to argue because Lucy was pretty stubborn usually. I sighed and nodded. “Okay…”

But the excitement stayed with me. It felt like bubbles in my chest. After the fitting, I held the garment bag and thought about Craig’s smile. I told myself I would be quick. I would show him the dress, still in the bag, then come right back fast. Lucy wouldn’t even come to know.

I fell for Craig when I was a sophomore in college. He was a senior. He helped me carry books on a rainy day and walked me to the parking lot. We started texting, then going for coffee. He asked about my classes and remembered small things. I liked that, and over time I started to love him.

After college, he kept seeing me. We met each other’s families. My father, Jared Williams, ran a fashion house, so there were events and shows. Craig came with me, smiled for photos, and held my hand. He was the only heir of his parents with two hotels.

The night he proposed, we were on the terrace of his parents’ hotel. There were lights and music. He went down on one knee with a ring. I was so thrill | Bella

Before I turned eighteen, I was used to having a hard life. When I was first born, I had a loving family. I had a mom and two dads, and three brothers. And we were all one big happy family, or so I thought. When I was ten, something happened to cause my parents to split up. I never did find out what happened to cause it.
All I knew was that the boys and I had to go and have DNA tests done to find out which of us belonged to my dad, Sean. Unfortunately for me, I was the only one that the test showed belonged to him. So, I had to spend every weekend at his house with him. And most of my breaks from school were spent at his house. I hated it.
He was always very abusive to me, and it was mentally and emotionally most of the time. When he only had me on the weekends, he would stick to mentally and emotionally abusing me. But when I had to spend a longer amount of time with him, it would get physical. He would beat me and lock me in a closet for hours at a time, sometimes for days.

Sirens screamed as the Royal Special Forces—elite operators—surrounded the auction house, making it impossible to escape.

""All units, lock it down!""

""Fox has been spotted at Waylen Auction House! Her target tonight—Rothialand's 'Blood Ruby'!""

""She can't get away!""

""Seal every exit! Not a single bug gets out!""

But they were already too late.

Inside, a thick, smoky fog had knocked out everyone—guards, big shots—leaving them slumped on the floor.

Among the unconscious crowd, a woman in a sleek black velvet gown walked confidently toward the stage.

She took a gas mask from her bag, sliding it on with practiced ease.

Anyone watching the feed might've thought she was just another rich guest... until she pulled a hairpin from her hair, bent it into a lockpick, and jammed it into the lock of the safe holding the Blood Ruby.

Click. The ""unhackable"" lock popped open like a cheap toy.

""Sorry, folks,"" she said with a sly smirk, winking at the security camera. ""Thanks for the party, but I'm taking this shiny rock home.

""Night-night.""

Right there, with everyone watching, she snatched the Blood Ruby and pocketed it like it was no big deal.

Yup, that was her.

No one knew her past. No one knew who she worked for.

But everyone knew her name—Fox. The greatest thief in the world, slipping in and out of palaces and vaults like they were nothing.

The only agent ever given a 5S ""global threat"" classification.

But deep in her mind was another name: Narissa Everton.

""Little Narissa... my sweet flower..."" That lullaby from her mother.

Too bad time had blurred the rest. All Narissa could remember was her mother's warm smile—nothing else about where she came from.

With the Blood Ruby in her grip, Narissa was ready to ghost, same as always.

Among the unconscious crowd, a woman in a sleek black velvet gown walked confidently toward the stage.

She took a gas mask from her bag, sliding it on with practiced ease.

Anyone watching the feed might've thought she was just another rich guest... until she pulled a hairpin from her hair, bent it into a lockpick, and jammed it into the lock of the safe holding the Blood Ruby.

Click. The ""unhackable"" lock popped open like a cheap toy.

""Sorry, folks,"" she said with a sly smirk, winking at the security camera. ""Thanks for the party, but I'm taking this shiny rock home.

""Night-night.""

Right there, with everyone watching, she snatched the Blood Ruby and pocketed it like it was no big deal.

Yup, that was her.

No one knew her past. No one knew who she worked for.

But everyone knew her name—Fox. The greatest thief in the world, slipping in and out of palaces and vaults like they were nothing.

The only agent ever given a 5S ""global threat"" classification.

But deep in her mind was another name: Narissa Everton.

""Little Narissa... my sweet flower..."" That lullaby from her mother.

Too bad time had blurred the rest. All Narissa could remember was her mother's warm smile—nothing else about where she came from.

With the Blood Ruby in her grip, Narissa was ready to ghost, same as always.

But then—

Bang!

A gunshot shatter | Everyone thought she was a hillbilly and looked down on her, but after she revealed her true identity, everyone was scared silly！！！🥵🥵🥵😱😱😱

It was midnight on Boaz Street, Orsin City.

Beep beep beep—

Sirens screamed as the Royal Special Forces—elite operators—surrounded the auction house, making it impossible to escape.

""All units, lock it down!""

""Fox has been spotted at Waylen Auction House! Her target tonight—Rothialand's 'Blood Ruby'!""

""She can't get away!""

""Seal every exit! Not a single bug gets out!""

My name is Tulip Ivy Sterling, and I am 23 years old. My life has been one big trial of ups and downs. And I have to say, there have been more downs than ups. Especially over the last few years. And it has been so hard. Harder than what I had thought that my life would be after I turned eighteen.
Before I turned eighteen, I was used to having a hard life. When I was first born, I had a loving family. I had a mom and two dads, and three brothers. And we were all one big happy family, or so I thought. When I was ten, something happened to cause my parents to split up. I never did find out what happened to cause it.
All I knew was that the boys and I had to go and have DNA tests done to find out which of us belonged to my dad, Sean. Unfortunately for me, I was the only one that the test showed belonged to him. So, I had to spend every weekend at his house with him. And most of my breaks from school were spent at his house. I hated it.
He was always very abusive to me, and it was mentally and emotionally most of the time. When he only had me on the weekends, he would stick to mentally and emotionally abusing me. But when I had to spend a longer amount of time with him, it would get physical. He would beat me and lock me in a closet for hours at a time, sometimes for days.

Tulip
My name is Tulip Ivy Sterling, and I am 23 years old. My life has been one big trial of ups and downs. And I have to say, there have been more downs than ups. Especially over the last few years. And it has been so hard. Harder than what I had thought that my life would be after I turned eighteen.
Before I turned eighteen, I was used to having a hard life. When I was first born, I had a loving family. I had a mom and two dads, and three brothers. And we were all one big happy family, or so I thought. When I was ten, something happened to cause my parents to split up. I never did find out what happened to cause it.
All I knew was that the boys and I had to go and have DNA tests done to find out which of us belonged to my dad, Sean. Unfortunately for me, I was the only one that the test showed belonged to him. So, I had to spend every weekend at his house with him. And most of my breaks from school were spent at his house. I hated it.
He was always very abusive to me, and it was mentally and emotionally most of the time. When he only had me on the weekends, he would stick to mentally and emotionally abusing me. But when I had to spend a longer amount of time with him, it would get physical. He would beat me and lock me in a closet for hours at a time, sometimes for days.

That's what scales your business.

I've seen it over and over again across hundreds of businesses.

A business spends $100k, $200k, $400k on leads that will never close.. Then they install a Qualified Lead System and they scale their business profitably.

I'll help you install this system to increase your lead quality basically over night, and give you a strategy and system to scale your advertising past 7 figures while removing yourself from the process.

Most of my clients have media buyers or agencies, but they don’t typically come with a scaling strategy.

They focus on cost per lead, but that doesn't put qualified leads on your closers' calendars, and any feedback just leads the marketing team to point fingers toward sales.

Which pulls you back in the weeds and out of solving higher level problems in your business.

This isn't always the advertisers fault, and you might not have to fire them.

But this doesn't fix itself, and the stakes get higher the longer you wait.

Good news is right now.. it’s way easier to get higher lead quality than it’s ever been.

You just need to install a Qualified Lead System for driving qualified leads predictably.

Once you have that, it gives you the stability to identify the real bottlenecks in your business, and map out a plan to scale over the next 6-12 months.

Stacey Crowell and her husband, Brent Crowell, were about to move to their new house.

While rummaging through Brent's safe, Stacey stumbled upon a bunch of old remittance slips hidden in the corner. They stretched back over several years.

Every single one was sent to the same person, Candice Thornton. She was Brent's first love.

Stacey couldn't help but feel a bit uneasy. She thought, 'How many years has it been since Brent broke up with Candice? They've both moved on and had their own families. Candice's youngest kid must be out of college by now, and yet they're still keeping in touch?'

Brent's expression shifted when he saw the remittance slips in her hand, but he didn't try to hide anything. ""Her husband passed away over ten years ago. She's been left to support her parents and two kids all by herself. She's barely scraping by, and on top of that, she got hepatitis.

""We've built our company up over the years and made a lot of money. This is just pocket change for us. Don't let it bother you, okay?""

Seeing how honest Brent was, Stacey let it go. She figured Brent was just repaying the Thornton family for their kindness. Besides, they'd been married for years, so she didn't want to make a big deal out of it.

She said, ""But I don't want you to keep supporting her. You can't help her forever.""

Anyway, Stacey just never liked Candice.

Brent agreed.

Just then, out of nowhere, a massive truck suddenly veered out of control and charged straight at their car.

My Sweet Little Luna,

It’s been far too long since I’ve seen that pretty scowl of yours. I wonder, does it deepen when you read my words? Do you bite that plush bottom lip, trying to hide the way I make you squirm?

You fight me so deliciously, Sorin. If only you knew how much it excites me.

But I digress. I grow impatient. I tire of these games you play, these futile little rejections. You will be mine. Whether you come to me willingly or not is up to you, but I do hope you choose the former.

P.S. When will you stop pretending your heart belongs to someone else? It’s adorable, really.

　I was lying in the hospital bed when Orson Romero came in with my medical report. ""Tabitha, when did you get hurt?"" he asked.
""A month ago. Why do you ask?"" I wondered, knuckles white.
　Orson was the doctor for the Red Moon Pack and my classmate from werewolf school.
""Your abdominal wound isn't healing as it should. For a werewolf, even serious injuries start patching up in about three days,"" Orson told me, his expression grave. Then he asked, ""So how did you get hurt exactly?""
""In an attack on my father's pack by rogues. Both my dad and I got injured,"" I replied, staring at the floor.
　Dad's business was slow, so I came home for a visit. That was when the rogues raided the Silver Moon Pack all of a sudden.
　They were extremely cruel and savage.
　Fortunately, the other pack members escaped serious harm. Only Dad's head and my abdomen were wounded.
　I had expected a swift recovery, but to my surprise, I found myself getting weaker.
　Snapping back to reality, I looked up at Orson and asked, ""When will I get better?""
""Well, can't give you a concrete answer on that one. You gotta have a thorough check-up once you're admitted. And I needa snag a sample from that wound for testing.

""Alright. I'll zip it. Hey, you're the pack's Luna, right? Stick close to your mate, that'll help,"" he reassured me.

I saw a cardiologist last week and she confirmed - once again - that my situation is terminal. She was from Manchester in the UK, and the previous week, she had taken her son to see Oasis in Melbourne.

I am not afraid of dying, but I am afraid of living this way for much longer.

A few days ago, Razor was fired from his position as the All Blacks' head coach; so there are people, as well as me, who are in a really bad way. It's a tragic thing to be fired from your lifetime dream.

I have thoroughly enjoyed most of my life, but I was badly ripped off by a business partner around 25 years ago. Were I not to die, I would have to live with ruminating thoughts about this situation for the rest of my days. I gave him his start in business and everything I had, and he turned around and stole everything he could. Some people believe their own press kits, which they wrote themselves. These days, he promotes himself as some sort of crown prince, as if he hung the moon himself.

I have found that the best thing to do with an impending death is to dream a lot. This helps press the bad thoughts out. Poetry also helps; it is a beautiful thing.

I read about Jorge Luis Borges, the famed South American literary giant - blind, I believe, and a writing genius. He says that when he was a kid, his father would pace up and down while reading poetry. Young Jorge couldn't understand the words, but he felt that something was happening to his whole body, mind, and spirit. It wasn't happening at an intellectual level. Maybe this is what the Aborigines call ""Dreamtime."" Any state that takes you out of your own thoughts has got to be a good thing, right?

“You’re sure about this, Mrs. Russo?” he asked quietly, hands folded over the folder in front of him.

The name sounded strange, like it belonged to someone else.

“Yes,” I said, my voice steady even though my pulse wasn’t. “I want the divorce filed quietly. I don’t want my husband or his people knowing until everything’s finalized.”

Ricci gave me a long, measuring look, but he didn’t question me further. Instead, he slid the paperwork towards me.

“You’ll need his signature on these.”

I nodded, slipping the papers into my leather folder. 

When I came back to the Russo mansion, it felt too quiet. The guards at the gate didn't even spare me a second glance as I walked in. No one here paid me any atten","[""fqwebsite.novellairs.com""]",False,False,2,"REG_CAT, CONSULT"

""Take your things and get out. No wonder I've always hated you. Turns out you were never my daughter in the first place.""

Ophelia Vossen hadn't even finished her breakfast when Abigail slammed a stack of personal documents onto the table in front of her.

The reason for Abigail's hatred was simple. Ophelia had lived for eighteen years as her daughter, enjoying the wealth and status of the Vossen family, while Abigail's real daughter had suffered in poverty, raised by a janitor's family.

""I understand."" Ophelia's tone was flat as she neatly slipped the documents into her black handbag.

Just then, the maid Mia spoke up. ""Ophelia, everything you own was provided by Mr. and Mrs. Vossen. You have no right to take anything from this house. May I check your bag?""

Reminded by Mia, Abigail immediately nodded. ""Yes. Check her bag.""

Cameron Vossen, seated at the head of the table, finally intervened, ""That's enough. Look at the size of that bag? What could she possibly take?""

But Ophelia didn't care. She turned the bag upside down, dumping everything onto the table.

""There's nothing in here except the laptop I bought with my scholarship money and an old phone. If you want them, you can have them,"" she said calmly.

From Ophelia's childhood, Abigail had been cold toward Ophelia. Abigail doted only on her sons, leaving Ophelia to fend for herself.

Ophelia had never spent the family's money; she even turned over her scholarship funds to the household. Nothing in this house truly belonged to her, and she had no desire to take any of it.

Abigail scoffed at her defiant tone, ""Scholarship money? If we hadn't paid for your tuition at Dunhollow University, would you have even gotten a scholarship?""

Before I turned eighteen, I was used to having a hard life. When I was first born, I had a loving family. I had a mom and two dads, and three brothers. And we were all one big happy family, or so I thought. When I was ten, something happened to cause my parents to split up. I never did find out what happened to cause it.
All I knew was that the boys and I had to go and have DNA tests done to find out which of us belonged to my dad, Sean. Unfortunately for me, I was the only one that the test showed belonged to him.

I heard Derek's gentle, intimate voice when I was only three feet from the door.
Then it was her.
Vivian Clarke. 
His VP of Marketing.
Wearing the dress I'd complimented hours earlier—sitting on his desk, his hand on her waist, intimately.

Before I turned eighteen, I was used to having a hard life. When I was first born, I had a loving family. I had a mom and two dads, and three brothers. And we were all one big happy family, or so I thought. When I was ten, something happened to cause my parents to split up. I never did find out what happened to cause it.
All I knew was that the boys and I had to go and have DNA tests done to find out which of us belonged to my dad, Sean. Unfortunately for me, I was the only one that the test showed belonged to him. So, I had to spend every weekend at his house with him. And most of my breaks from school were spent at his house. I hated it.
He was always very abusive to me, and it was mentally and emotionally most of the time. When he only had me on the weekends, he would stick to mentally and emotionally abusing me. But when I had to spend a longer amount of time with him, it would get physical. He would beat me and lock me in a closet for hours at a time, sometimes for days.

And we were all one big happy family, or so I thought. When I was ten, something happened to cause my parents to split up. I never did find out what happened to cause it.
All I knew was that the boys and I had to go and have DNA tests done to find out which of us belonged to my dad, Sean. Unfortunately for me, I was the only one that the test showed belonged to him. So, I had to spend every weekend at his house with him. And most of my breaks from school were spent at his house. I hated it.
He was always very abusive to me, and it was mentally and emotionally most of the time. When he only had me on the weekends, he would stick to mentally and emotionally abusing me. But when I had to spend a longer amount of time with him, it would get physical. He would beat me and lock me in a closet for hours at a time, sometimes for days.

5 years later, she returns with his child—but the billionaire never stopped searching!
--------------------------------
He’s Been Looking for Her for Five Years! She Finally Appears
The cool night, silent and luxurious in the presidential suite.

Caitlin Lewis had a black blindfold over her eyes, her small hands tightly gripping the sheets, filled with tension and anxiety.

The mattress beside her suddenly sank under a heavy weight pressing down.

She could feel the man reaching out, and Caitlin quickly grabbed his wrist.

“Don’t look at my face!”

The man’s deep, magnetic voice spoke, “Don’t you want to know who you’re giving your first time to?”

Caitlin’s heart ached, warm tears spilling out as she shook her head. “I don’t care who you are. You’re my savior, thank you!”

She couldn’t let anyone know who she was!

If word got out that the eldest daughter of the Lewis family had fallen so low as to sell herself for $200,000, how much ridicule would she face?

Giving her most precious self to a stranger, she felt helpless and sorrowful.

But she had no choice. Her mother was lying in a hospital bed, waiting for money to save her life.

If it weren’t for her father’s coldness and her boyfriend’s betrayal—stealing her shares and kicking her out—she wouldn’t have to resort to this.

A faint, seductive scent filled the air.

The girl was clean, and she smelled good!

The man made another request, “I can give you two million, but I want you to have a baby for me. Would you agree?”

With two million, her mother could be saved!

“I agree…”

“Good girl.”

The man curved his lips into a charming smile, leaning in closer.

Eight months later, one night.

Caitlin was jolted awake by the pungent smell of smoke. She opened her eyes to see flames outside the window, long tongues of fire licking through the frame, igniting the curtains.

Fire!

Realizing the danger, Caitlin, with her large belly, struggl | My fiancé is gay
Gracie

My fiancé is gay.

That was the thought echoing through my head as I stood there frozen, watching a scene I could never unsee. I stared at the man thrusting into my fiancé’s ass, and at Charles moaning like a goddamn whore in heat.

This was my fiance, the man I was supposed to marry in five days. The man I had shared a bed, a future, a life with for five whole years. But he was there, legs spread wide, eyes rolled back in bliss I had never seen cross his face when he was with me.

I couldn’t breathe anymore, everywhere felt like it was spinning. The sound of skin slapping against skin filled the room. I wanted to look away, but I couldn’t. My eyes stayed locked, watching as if my brain couldn’t register that this was real.

“Ah, fuck, Mark… yes, I love this… fuck… you’re so big.” Charles moaned, and the words hit me like punches to the gut. 

My hand flew to my mouth, pressing hard to keep the nausea down. My heart felt like it had been torn from my chest and shoved down a garbage disposal. Was this a nightmare? Was I going to wake up in our apartment, beside him, with his arms around me and none of this real?

“Fuck yeah, Charles, baby,” the man grunted. “Take my big boy. Take him good.”

“Ah, daddy! Give me your big boy!!!”

Tears burned the back of my eyes. My knees buckled slightly, and I reached out to the doorframe for support. Daddy? He had never called me anything in bed. What was I saying? He had never seemed that interested in sex with me. Two minutes. That was the amount of minutes he took before he came. Anytime I asked him for more, he would say he was tired or he would just give me a disgusted look before leaving. 

My mind raced, spiraling out of control.

Is he gay? Bisexual? Has he always been like this? Had he been faking it with me? All these years? Every kiss, every time he said I love you, every plan we made for the future, was it all a lie?

I felt humiliated, sick, and like a goddamn fool.

Tucked away at the serene base of a slumbering mountain, a vision arrested your gaze: a contemporary courtyard that stood as a testament to architectural harmony. It was a fusion of minimalist elegance and style, where tradition met modernity in a seamless blend.

""Yves, take a seat and stay out of trouble,"" Andy Leach, Yves's cousin, instructed, his eyes scanning the bustling courtyard with a touch of confusion.

And honestly, we hate hearing that. Sick kids are serious business, and for many families it’s more than just a rough week…it can mean missed school, missed work, and a lot of stress.

That’s exactly why, from the very beginning, it was important to us to build a gym that’s easy to clean the RIGHT way. We weren't interested in massive or jam-packed with sensory-stimulating toys and experiences - because our space was intentionally designed to be safe, accessible, and supportive for neurodivergent kids—while still being a place where all children can play, move, and grow together. Every piece of equipment was chosen with safety and cleanliness top of mind.

Anywhere kids are automatically becomes a high-touch surface...and for us...high-touch surfaces mean even higher standards. We see the value in cleaning our gym multiple times a day, deep-cleaning toys and equipment regularly, and staying on top of the details so families can relax when they're hanging out with us. 

You won’t find broken toys or sticky surfaces here—and if you ever notice something that needs attention, we want you to tell us - we even have a special basket for dirty toys (or toys that were just TOO tempting to keep out of mouths 😉).

Tulip
My name is Tulip Ivy Sterling, and I am 23 years old. My life has been one big trial of ups and downs. And I have to say, there have been more downs than ups. Especially over the last few years. And it has been so hard. Harder than what I had thought that my life would be after I turned eighteen.
Before I turned eighteen, I was used to having a hard life. When I was first born, I had a loving family. I had a mom and two dads, and three brothers. And we were all one big happy family, or so I thought. When I was ten, something happened to cause my parents to split up. I never did find out what happened to cause it.
All I knew was that the boys and I had to go and have DNA tests done to find out which of us belonged to my dad, Sean. Unfortunately for me, I was the only one that the test showed belonged to him. So, I had to spend every weekend at his house with him. And most of my breaks from school were spent at his house. I hated it.
He was always very abusive to me, and it was mentally and emotionally most of the time. When he only had me on the weekends, he would stick to mentally and emotionally abusing me. But when I had to spend a longer amount of time with him, it would get physical. He would beat me and lock me in a closet for hours at a time, sometimes for days.

Chapter 1 The Leach Family's Visit
In the heartland where rustic routines and predictable landscapes often prevailed, Saphira was a whisper of novelty that danced on the breeze, defying the clichés of a behindhand place.
This small town was no ordinary collection of homes; it was a tapestry of pristine, cobblestone paths, quaint mini-mansions that whispered tales of cozy comfort, and log cabins adorned with designer flair.
Tucked away at the serene base of a slumbering mountain, a vision arrested your gaze: a contemporary courtyard that stood as a testament to architectural harmony. It was a fusion of minimalist elegance and style, where tradition met modernity in a seamless blend.

My name is Tulip Ivy Sterling, and I am 23 years old. My life has been one big trial of ups and downs. And I have to say, there have been more downs than ups. Especially over the last few years. And it has been so hard. Harder than what I had thought that my life would be after I turned eighteen.
Before I turned eighteen, I was used to having a hard life. When I was first born, I had a loving family. I had a mom and two dads, and three brothers. And we were all one big happy family, or so I thought. When I was ten, something happened to cause my parents to split up. I never did find out what happened to cause it.
All I knew was that the boys and I had to go and have DNA tests done to find out which of us belonged to my dad, Sean. Unfortunately for me, I was the only one that the test showed belonged to him. So, I had to spend every weekend at his house with him. And most of my breaks from school were spent at his house. I hated it.
He was always very abusive to me, and it was mentally and emotionally most of the time. When he only had me on the weekends, he would stick to mentally and emotionally abusing me. But when I had to spend a longer amount of time with him, it would get physical. He would beat me and lock me in a closet for hours at a time, sometimes for days.

‘You are cursed, you little bitch! Always keep your wolf on a leash or you will regret it!” My pack Alpha had said before throwing me in a dungeon and leaving me to starve for days. 

That was years ago. 

Now, those words from my past rang at the back of my mind as I waited in line outside an office to submit my application form. 

The two princes of the Alpha King had come to my school to recruit final year students for their coveted Elite Warrior program and I was eager to jump on it. At this point in my life, I needed anything that could help me get away from my evil pack and the hell that my life had become. 

‘You are cursed.’

A couple of giggles brought me out of my tortured thoughts and when I raised my head to see the source, I immediately rolled my eyes. Bessie Crow - queen bee of Lycantide High just arrived with her brainless minions and they were standing at a glass window, peeking in on the Princes. 

Bessie said something to her friends before flipping her golden blonde hair behind her. She entered into the office with a package in her hand and if I guessed right, that package probably contained some store-bought cupcakes she’ll pretend to have made just to impress. 

Pathetic.

The two princes of the Alpha King had come to my school to recruit final year students for their coveted Elite Warrior program and I was eager to jump on it. At this point in my life, I needed anything that could help me get away from my evil pack and the hell that my life had become.

My name is Tulip Ivy Sterling, and I am 23 years old. My life has been one big trial of ups and downs. And I have to say, there have been more downs than ups. Especially over the last few years. And it has been so hard. Harder than what I had thought that my life would be after I turned eighteen.
Before I turned eighteen, I was used to having a hard life. When I was first born, I had a loving family. I had a mom and two dads, and three brothers. And we were all one big happy family, or so I thought. When I was ten, something happened to cause my parents to split up. I never did find out what happened to cause it.
All I knew was that the boys and I had to go and have DNA tests done to find out which of us belonged to my dad, Sean. Unfortunately for me, I was the only one that the test showed belonged to him. So, I had to spend every weekend at his house with him. And most of my breaks from school were spent at his house. I hated it.
He was always very abusive to me, and it was mentally and emotionally most of the time. When he only had me on the weekends, he would stick to mentally and emotionally abusing me. But when I had to spend a longer amount of time with him, it would get physical. He would beat me and lock me in a closet for hours at a time, sometimes for days.

First and foremost, I do amazing work.

I don't settle for anything less.

No corner cutting.

No junky materials.

But there's more…

Build your Google profile and review base to the point you are winning local search in your market. 

Have a good process to take leads from interested in a trial, to new student.

Our Alpha Jeremiah—more than a brother to me—was already there, pulling me into his arms. Since the car accident, I had been taken in by the werewolf pack. But I was still human. I would never have a wolf. Never have a mate. And I would never truly belong.
Now that Jeremiah had found his mate, I knew I couldn’t rely on him forever. I had to learn to stand on my own quickly.
When I accompanied him to visit his mate’s pack, a sudden, intoxicating scent filled the air. My breath caught.
I looked up.
Ryker, the infamous Alpha of the Dark Moon Pack, was watching me.
--
The peeling sound of screeching tires.  A loud thunk and an explosion of glass.  An invisible force throwing me forward. But no control over anything, nothing to grab as my hands fly through the air.  I hit a solid surface and jolted up. 
I gasp as I blink my eyes open. I’m in my room. I am always in my room. I can still smell burned rubber and gas though.  The pungent fumes still burn in my nose.  This nightmare will never go away.  It’s the same thing every night. It has been for two years.  I take another deep breath in, trying to clear the smell from my nose and the sight from the back of my eyelids.
My door bursts open and my best friend comes flying at me.  He says nothing, just climbs under the cushiony down blanket and wraps me in his arms, placing my head on his chest. His heartbeat and smell is comforting enough for me to fall back into a dreamless sleep.
I have had the same dream every night since the crash. I have been to every doctor that Aunt Beth has sent me to and nothing seems to make it better, except being near Jeremiah. It is messing with my life which is already a complete sh*tshow anyway. It’s also not super convenient for him either.
Aunt Beth and Uncle James have done so much for me the last couple years. They didn’t have to, but they still took me in without question.

At three in the morning, I push against the man's lean, moving waist,
only for him to grab my wrist and flip me over, his voice low and rough,
""Shut up and stay down! I'm not finished yet... just bear with it a little longer...""
I clench my eyes shut, swallowing my moans.
This might be the last time I sleep with him—this very morning, I secretly visited a law firm and drafted divorce papers behind his back.
Our marriage was a matter of convenience, a business deal, plain and simple.
For me, it was security. For him, it was proof of a legal identity.
Three years married,
he likes having s*x with me, but he doesn't like me.
There was a time when Dominic couldn't keep his hands off me.
He'd pull me into dimly lit hallways and steal kisses during family gatherings.
I thought,
maybe someday I could make him love me too.
But when Alessia reappeared in our lives, and his late-night meetings doubled, I lost all hope.
Dominic's rough kisses leave me burning, the fading heat from my last climax already threatening to return.
Then a ringtone cuts through—and he suddenly stills.
Glancing at the caller ID, he pulls out of me without hesitation, still hard, and answers the phone, his voice uncharacteristically soft,
""Alessia, what's wrong? Don't cry. I'll be right there.""
Unspeakable frustration twists inside me.
With a tear-choked voice, I beg him, ""Please… don't go…""
Dominic doesn't respond.
Helplessness, ache, and the sting of rejection flood my chest—mixed with something deeper than desire, more like grief…
""Wait—before you go, I just need you to sign a few documents.""
I call out hoarsely,
climbing off the bed and pulling the divorce papers from my bag, quickly flipping to the signature page.
""What's this?"" Dominic frowns at the documents.
""Just some safety liability forms for a new project I’m starting with a company,"" I say, sliding the papers across the glossy wooden table toward him.
""I need your signature—you’re my only family no | ""She reminds me of my late wife.""
Meeting Isabella again, Dominic felt like he was going insane.
He'd actually fallen for a married woman with a child.
He envied her husband. The thought of them sharing a bed drove him mad with jealousy—he wanted to lock her away, keep her beneath him and only him.
He clung to her like a man possessed…
until he accidentally discovered a secret hidden in her home,
a child who looked exactly like him.

The Divorce
The small law office smelled faintly of dust and old paper. A flickering lamp in the corner gave off a weak, tired glow, casting shadows across the stacks of files lining the shelves.

I sat across from Mr. Ricci, an older man with sharp glasses and sharper instincts.

“You’re sure about this, Mrs. Russo?” he asked quietly, hands folded over the folder in front of him.

The name sounded strange, like it belonged to someone else.

“Yes,” I said, my voice steady even though my pulse wasn’t. “I want the divorce filed quietly. I don’t want my husband or his people knowing until everything’s finalized.”

Ricci gave me a long, measuring look, but he didn’t question me further. Instead, he slid the paperwork towards me.

“You’ll need his signature on these.”

I nodded, slipping the papers into my leather folder. 

When I came back to the Russo mansion, it felt too quiet. The guards at the gate didn't even spare me a second glance as I walked in. No one here paid me any attention now that I was reduced to the side piece in my own marriage. And the worst part? The worst part was my husband didn't even care. 

Knowing he would be in the study, I moved towards it and was proven right when Alessia's laughter tinkled out through the half open door. These days, where Alessia was, my husband wasn't too far away. 

""—so funny,"" Alessia, my husband's childhood best friend, who was back in the city after her divorce was saying. 

""I know, I'm the best,"" came Dominic's reply, his tone the most casual and relaxed I'd ever heard it be.

The August sun hits like a spotlight when I step off the bus, and for a second, it’s hard to tell if the heat prickling under my skin is nerves or excitement. Probably both.

College. A new start. A clean page.

No one here knows who I was in high school — the quiet girl with the perfect GPA and the predictable life. Here, I get to decide who I am.

The student tour guide waves a clipboard in the air. “Welcome to Hartwell University! Let’s get started over by the quad!”

I adjust the strap of my bag and fall in with the crowd, doing my best to look like I belong. The campus smells like fresh-cut grass and coffee, and everyone’s talking over each other — new roommates, majors, dorms, everything at once.

And then I see him.

Of course I do.

Logan Shaw.

He’s standing a few rows back, hair still that messy brown that always looks like it should’ve fallen in his eyes but never quite does. Same careless grin. Same stupid confidence.

He’s got a hockey duffel slung over one shoulder, and even from here I can see how his arms have filled out since high school. He laughs at something a teammate says, loud and easy, like the world’s already decided to make room for him.

My heart drops, just a little.

Because for a second — only a second — I’m back in that hallway at West Ridge High, listening to him brag about skipping prom for “playoffs,” like feelings were a distraction, like people were just background noise to his goals.

Guess some things don’t change.

I square my shoulders and look away.

The tour guide points toward the bell tower, saying something about its history since the 1800s. Half the group’s listening. The other half is either texting or staring at the girl with the clipboard. Typical.

When I glance back again, Logan’s looking right at me.

Not by accident. Not even pretending it’s by accident.

My name is Tulip Ivy Sterling, and I am 23 years old. My life has been one big trial of ups and downs. And I have to say, there have been more downs than ups. Especially over the last few years. And it has been so hard. Harder than what I had thought that my life would be after I turned eighteen.
Before I turned eighteen, I was used to having a hard life. When I was first born, I had a loving family. I had a mom and two dads, and three brothers. And we were all one big happy family, or so I thought. When I was ten, something happened to cause my parents to split up. I never did find out what happened to cause it.
All I knew was that the boys and I had to go and have DNA tests done to find out which of us belonged to my dad, Sean. Unfortunately for me, I was the only one that the test showed belonged to him. So, I had to spend every weekend at his house with him. And most of my breaks from school were spent at his house. I hated it.
He was always very abusive to me, and it was mentally and emotionally most of the time. When he only had me on the weekends, he would stick to mentally and emotionally abusing me. But when I had to spend a longer amount of time with him, it would get physical. He would beat me and lock me in a closet for hours at a time, sometimes for days.

A low, intimate laugh came from Derek's locked office.
I froze, an earring slipping from my finger. The sound came from his private office, the one even the cleaning staff locked.

""Charlie doesn't understand me the way you do.""
I heard Derek's gentle, intimate voice when I was only three feet from the door.
Then it was her.
Vivian Clarke. 
His VP of Marketing.
Wearing the dress I'd complimented hours earlier—sitting on his desk, his hand on her waist, intimately.
I didn't gasp. Instead, I stood there for a full three seconds, with a shock-stricken calm, meticulously recording every detail.
The way her fingers were twirling in his hair. The lipstick mark on his collar.The champagne gla-sses on his desk two of them, half-empty, celebratory.
Then I closed the door. Carefully, silently. So quietly that they didn't even notice.
He's a hero in their eyes. A visionary. A godda-mn saint.

I stand in front of the bathroom mirror, fingers working the clasp of the Cartier necklace Derrick gave me for our fifth anniversary. The woman staring back at me looks like she belongs in a magazine spread sleek updo, perfect makeup, designer gown that probably cost more than most people's monthly mortgage. But her eyes are tired. No, not tired. Empty.
I finally get the necklace undone and set it on the marble counter with a soft clink. The sound echoes in the cavernous bathroom, all gleaming fixtures and heated floors. This penthouse has everything. Everything except the one thing I actually need a husband who looks at me like I matter.

His words hit me like a gentle shock，my brothers had been searching for me all this time.
A faint warmth spread through my chest, chasing away some of the chill of fear.

Oh sh-it.
I sat frozen in my place. My 17-year-old but, which has seen better, and worse days was numb from not moving for a few hours so I couldn't have been sure whether someone stitched it to the uncomfortable leather seat. It would explain my lack of movement, right?

""All units, lock it down!""

""Fox has been spotted at Waylen Auction House! Her target tonight—Rothialand's 'Blood Ruby'!""

""She can't get away!""

""Seal every exit! Not a single bug gets out!""

But they were already too late.

Inside, a thick, smoky fog had knocked out everyone—guards, big shots—leaving them slumped on the floor.

Among the unconscious crowd, a woman in a sleek black velvet gown walked confidently toward the stage.

She took a gas mask from her bag, sliding it on with practiced ease.

Anyone watching the feed might've thought she was just another rich guest... until she pulled a hairpin from her hair, bent it into a lockpick, and jammed it into the lock of the safe holding the Blood Ruby.

Click. The ""unhackable"" lock popped open like a cheap toy.

""Sorry, folks,"" she said with a sly smirk, winking at the security camera. ""Thanks for the party, but I'm taking this shiny rock home.

""Night-night.""

Right there, with everyone watching, she snatched the Blood Ruby and pocketed it like it was no big deal.

Yup, that was her.

No one knew her past. No one knew who she worked for.

But everyone knew her name—Fox. The greatest thief in the world, slipping in and out of palaces and vaults like they were nothing.

The only agent ever given a 5S ""global threat"" classification.

But deep in her mind was another name: Narissa Everton.

""Little Narissa... my sweet flower..."" That lullaby from her mother.

Too bad time had blurred the rest. All Narissa could remember was her mother's warm smile—nothing else about where she came from.

With the Blood Ruby in her grip, Narissa was ready to ghost, same as always.

Before I turned eighteen, I was used to having a hard life. When I was first born, I had a loving family. I had a mom and two dads, and three brothers. And we were all one big happy family, or so I thought. When I was ten, something happened to cause my parents to split up. I never did find out what happened to cause it.
All I knew was that the boys and I had to go and have DNA tests done to find out which of us belonged to my dad, Sean. Unfortunately for me, I was the only one that the test showed belonged to him. So, I had to spend every weekend at his house with him. And most of my breaks from school were spent at his house. I hated it.
He was always very abusive to me, and it was mentally and emotionally most of the time. When he only had me on the weekends, he would stick to mentally and emotionally abusing me. But when I had to spend a longer amount of time with him, it would get physical. He would beat me and lock me in a closet for hours at a time, sometimes for days.

only for him to grab my wrist and flip me over, his voice low and rough,
""Shut up and stay down! I'm not finished yet... just bear with it a little longer...""
I clench my eyes shut, swallowing my moans.
This might be the last time I sleep with him—this very morning, I secretly visited a law firm and drafted divorce papers behind his back.
Our marriage was a matter of convenience, a business deal, plain and simple.
For me, it was security. For him, it was proof of a legal identity.
Three years married,
he likes having s*x with me, but he doesn't like me.
There was a time when Dominic couldn't keep his hands off me.
He'd pull me into dimly lit hallways and steal kisses during family gatherings.
I thought,
maybe someday I could make him love me too.
But when Alessia reappeared in our lives, and his late-night meetings doubled, I lost all hope.
Dominic's rough kisses leave me burning, the fading heat from my last climax already threatening to return.
Then a ringtone cuts through—and he suddenly stills.
Glancing at the caller ID, he pulls out of me without hesitation, still hard, and answers the phone, his voice uncharacteristically soft,
""Alessia, what's wrong? Don't cry. I'll be right there.""
Unspeakable frustration twists inside me.
With a tear-choked voice, I beg him, ""Please… don't go…""
Dominic doesn't respond.
Helplessness, ache, and the sting of rejection flood my chest—mixed with something deeper than desire, more like grief…
""Wait—before you go, I just need you to sign a few documents.""
I call out hoarsely,
climbing off the bed and pulling the divorce papers from my bag, quickly flipping to the signature page.
""What's this?"" Dominic frowns at the documents.
""Just some safety liability forms for a new project I’m starting with a company,"" I say, sliding the papers across the glossy wooden table toward him.
""I need your signature—you’re my only family no | ""Honey... mmm... I'm tired... no more...""
At three in the morning, I push against the man's lean, moving waist,
only for him to grab my wrist and flip me over, his voice low and rough,
""Shut up and stay down! I'm not finished yet... just bear with it a little longer...""
I clench my eyes shut, swallowing my moans.
This might be the last time I sleep with him—this very morning, I secretly visited a law firm and drafted divorce papers behind his back.
Our marriage was a matter of convenience, a business deal, plain and simple.
For me, it was security. For him, it was proof of a legal identity.
Three years married,
he likes having s*x with me, but he doesn't like me.
There was a time when Dominic couldn't keep his hands off me.
He'd pull me into dimly lit hallways and steal kisses during family gatherings.
I thought,
maybe someday I could make him love me too.
But when Alessia reappeared in our lives, and his late-night meetings doubled, I lost all hope.
Dominic's rough kisses leave me burning, the fading heat from my last climax already threatening to return.
Then a ringtone cuts through—and he suddenly stills.
Glancing at the caller ID, he pulls out of me without hesitation, still hard, and answers the phone, his voice uncharacteristically soft,
""Alessia, what's wrong? Don't cry. I'll be right there.""
Unspeakable frustration twists inside me.
With a tear-choked voice, I beg him, ""Please… don't go…""
Dominic doesn't respond.
Helplessness, ache, and the sting of rejection flood my chest—mixed with something deeper than desire, more like grief…

Chapter 1 The Leach Family's Visit
In the heartland where rustic routines and predictable landscapes often prevailed, Saphira was a whisper of novelty that danced on the breeze, defying the clichés of a behindhand place.
This small town was no ordinary collection of homes; it was a tapestry of pristine, cobblestone paths, quaint mini-mansions that whispered tales of cozy comfort, and log cabins adorned with designer flair.
Tucked away at the serene base of a slumbering mountain, a vision arrested your gaze: a contemporary courtyard that stood as a testament to architectural harmony. It was a fusion of minimalist elegance and style, where tradition met modernity in a seamless blend.
And what a revelation it was to learn that the architect of this masterpiece was Cherise Leach, a young woman on the cusp of her twenties.

The diamonds feel heavier coming off than they did going on.
I stand in front of the bathroom mirror, fingers working the clasp of the Cartier necklace Derrick gave me for our fifth anniversary. The woman staring back at me looks like she belongs in a magazine spread sleek updo, perfect makeup, designer gown that probably cost more than most people's monthly mortgage. But her eyes are tired. No, not tired. Empty.
I finally get the necklace undone and set it on the marble counter with a soft clink. The sound echoes in the cavernous bathroom, all gleaming fixtures and heated floors. This penthouse has everything. Everything except the one thing I actually need a husband who looks at me like I matter.

Before I turned eighteen, I was used to having a hard life. When I was first born, I had a loving family. I had a mom and two dads, and three brothers. And we were all one big happy family, or so I thought. When I was ten, something happened to cause my parents to split up. I never did find out what happened to cause it.
All I knew was that the boys and I had to go and have DNA tests done to find out which of us belonged to my dad, Sean. Unfortunately for me, I was the only one that the test showed belonged to him. So, I had to spend every weekend at his house with him. And most of my breaks from school were spent at his house. I hated it.
He was always very abusive to me, and it was mentally and emotionally most of the time. When he only had me on the weekends, he would stick to mentally and emotionally abusing me. But when I had to spend a longer amount of time with him, it would get physical. He would beat me and lock me in a closet for hours at a time, sometimes for days.

“We've let you down,” Teo murmured.
“I’m so sorry,” Alex said, his gaze earnest. 
I whispered, “I believe you.”
For the first time in years, I felt a glimmer of something like belonging.

Oh sh-it.
I sat frozen in my place. My 17-year-old but, which has seen better, and worse days was numb from not moving for a few hours so I couldn't have been sure whether someone stitched it to the uncomfortable leather seat. It would explain my lack of movement, right?

I slowly blinked at him, realising I was, in fact, not paralyzed. Good. That was the impulse I needed to clear my throat and stand up awkwardly. He was tall. Too tall. But honestly, due to my up bringing, everyone was taller than me.

I heard Derek's gentle, intimate voice when I was only three feet from the door.
Then it was her.
Vivian Clarke. 
His VP of Marketing.

I didn't gasp. Instead, I stood there for a full three seconds, with a shock-stricken calm, meticulously recording every detail.
The way her fingers were twirling in his hair. The lipstick mark on his collar.The champagne gla-sses on his desk two of them, half-empty, celebratory.
Then I closed the door. Carefully, silently. So quietly that they didn't even notice.
He's a hero in their eyes. A visionary. A godda-mn saint.
And I'm the idiot who believed him.
This perfect life is a lie, and I’m done playing along.

The diamonds feel heavier coming off than they did going on.
I stand in front of the bathroom mirror, fingers working the clasp of the Cartier necklace Derrick gave me for our fifth anniversary. The woman staring back at me looks like she belongs in a magazine spread sleek updo, perfect makeup, designer gown that probably cost more than most people's monthly mortgage. But her eyes are tired. No, not tired. Empty.
I finally get the necklace undone and set it on the marble counter with a soft clink. The sound echoes in the cavernous bathroom, all gleaming fixtures and heated floors. This penthouse has everything. Everything except the one thing I actually need a husband who looks at me like I matter.

(Eli)

Cameras flashed everywhere as soon as Landon and I stepped out of the limousine. My husband possessively wrapped his arm around my waist. His smile was dazzling and gentle, making me smile just as sweetly as we walked together towards the Caldwell Hotel where all the wealthy and powerful people gathered.

Landon stopped for a moment to tuck a stray strand of my hair behind my ear before dropping a kiss on my forehead and tugging me closer to his side. I heard the sighs of the female reporters as they glanced his way. Why wouldn’t they? Landon was every wife’s dream man. Gorgeous, hot, tall, gentle and a very devoted husband. And the cherry on top? He was one of the richest men in and out of the country. Every newspaper and magazine featured his success in the businesses he opened where he talked about his wife as his inspiration.

Wherever we went, people congratulated me for bagging the most eligible bachelor in America.

The media loved Landon Richards. Men envied him. Kids wanted to be like him when they grew up. The women went crazy over him despite his marital status.

Once upon a time, I was one of those women too.

“Smile, Elianna. Your mask is slipping away,” Landon whispered, concealing his warning with another camera-ready smile. “You are too damn beautiful to be locked up for a day or two in the attic.”

My stomach instantly recoiled at the memory of sleeping in that cold space for two days without food, just a bottle of water, as Landon insisted that he needed to do that for me to learn. And all that happened just because I refused to keep acting as his perfect wife during one of the parties we attended.

I married a psycho.

And it was too late when I found out.

The worst part was that I couldn’t escape. My stepfather had lost his construction company due to his gambling addiction. His debts piled up. Landon paid all of them and kept our company afloat. He was the reason why my stepfather and brother could continue their lavish lifesty | Chapter 1

Sara’s mind reeled as she left the gallery with Kaleb. His words laced with sincerity, contradicted the doubts creeping into her mind. She couldn’t shake off the feeling that he was hiding something.
As they strolled through the quiet streets, Keleb pointed out his favorite landmarks, sharing stories about the city’s history. Sara listened intently, her heart torn between her growing connection with Kaleb and the unease settling in.
“Kaleb, can I ask you something?” Sara said, her voice barely above a whisper.
“Anything,” Kakeb replied, his eyes locked onto hers.
“What happened with Tara?” Sara’s question hung in the air like a challenge.
Kaleb’s expression faltered for a moment before he regained his composure. “I told you, Sara. We wanted different things. She was ambitious, and I wasn't ready to settle down.”
Sara’s eyes narrowed. “That’s not all, is it?”
Kaleb‘s pause was almost imperceptible. “What makes you think that?”
Sara’s instincts screamed that Kalen was hiding something. “I just feel it,” she said, her voice firm.
Kaleb’s gaze drifted away, his jaw clenched. For a moment, Sara wondered if she had touched too far.
As they continued walking, Sara’s phone buzzed in her pocket. She excused herself to check the message.
Anonymous: “You think you’ve gotten away with it, don't you? But I know the truth. You killed your husband and covered it up. Turn yourself in, or I’ll expose you.”
Sara’s blood ran cold. Her eyes widened in horror as she stared at the screen. Who could be sending her such vile accusations?
Kaleb noticed her distress. “Sara, what’s wrong?”
Sara quickly hid the message, trying to compose herself. “It’s just…..a wrong number,” she stammered.
Kaleb’s expression softened. “You’re shaking. Let’s get you out of here.”
Sara nodded, feeling a wave of panic wash over her. She couldn't let Kaleb see the message. What if he believed it?
As they walked away, Sara’s mind reeled. Who was behind these messages? And what did they want from her?

Several minutes ago, I received a message at the auction-you should know who your husband is having an affair with.
There was a link beneath the sentence.
My stomach drops. I tapped it. The livestream loaded instantly. 
Lucas was there. My husband of six years. Undressed.
There was also a woman beneath him.
Olivia Parker. My best friend.
I gagged, trying so hard to be quiet as tears started to fall.
Her nails dug into Lucas’s back, her head tilted, her voice loud enough to carry through the phone’s speaker.
“Tell me you love me more than her,” she said, breathless, her gaze lifting straight into the camera.
Lucas laughed. Low. Indulgent. 
“Harper?” he said, his hand slid up her throat. “She’s for optics. The wife the board likes. You’re the one I actually want.”
The words landed cleanly. No hesitation. No humor to soften them.
I felt my fingers go numb around the stem of my glass.
At the bottom corner of the screen, a number ticked upward. 187. 188. 189.
Each digit a tiny, tearing my heart apart.

The auctioneer’s voice carried across the ballroom, smooth and practiced, rising and falling with the rhythm of money being pledged for a cause no one here truly needed to believe in. Crystal chandeliers scattered light across silk gowns and tailored tuxedos. Laughter floated easily. Applause came on cue. Everything about the night was polished, expensive, and carefully staged.
My phone vibrated inside my clutch.
Once.
I ignored it at first. Everyone did, in rooms like this. Etiquette mattered more than urgency. Then it vibrated again, the faint hum sharp against my palm, persistent enough to pull my attention away from the stage.
Unknown number. One message.

The small law office smelled faintly of dust and old paper. A flickering lamp in the corner gave off a weak, tired glow, casting shadows across the stacks of files lining the shelves.

I sat across from Mr. Ricci, an older man with sharp glasses and sharper instincts.

“You’re sure about this, Mrs. Russo?” he asked quietly, hands folded over the folder in front of him.

The name sounded strange, like it belonged to someone else.

“Yes,” I said, my voice steady even though my pulse wasn’t. “I want the divorce filed quietly. I don’t want my husband or his people knowing until everything’s finalized.”

Ricci gave me a long, measuring look, but he didn’t question me further. Instead, he slid the paperwork towards me.

“You’ll need his signature on these.”

I nodded, slipping the papers into my leather folder. 

When I came back to the Russo mansion, it felt too quiet. The guards at the gate didn't even spare me a second glance as I walked in. No one here paid me any attention now that I was reduced to the side piece in my own marriage. And the worst part? The worst part was my husband didn't even care. 

Knowing he would be in the study, I moved towards it and was proven right when Alessia's laughter tinkled out through the half open door. These days, where Alessia was, my husband wasn't too far away. 

""—so funny,"" Alessia, my husband's childhood best friend, who was back in the city after her divorce was saying. 

""I know, I'm the best,"" came Dominic's reply, his tone the most casual and relaxed I'd ever heard it be. 

On instinct, I opened the study door all the way through and stepped inside. 

Dominic Russo froze with his whisky glass halfway to his mouth as he looked at me standing in the doorway, his smile dropping at once. 

""Oh, hey, Isabella! You're back from your studio already?"" Alessia said, her perfectly painted lips pulling into a broad smile as she looked at me.

For only $3. 😲 And if you've been struggling with the law of attraction, if you've been trying to understand how all of this mumbo jumbo and this esoteric voodoo actually works, you've come to the right place.

I have spent four decades, learning how to create your own reality from the inside out.

I'm Dr. Joe Vitale. I was in the movie The Secret. I have my own movie coming out called Zero Limits. 

I've written 90 some books including the Attractor Factor and Zero Limits and Zero Limits Living, and a whole lot more. I have hundreds of products. I have a coaching program. I have been in this business for a very long time.

I've also struggled.

I was homeless, I was in poverty. I know what it's like to starve. I know what it's like to be despondent. I know what it's like to even be suicidal. 

I transcended all of that, and what I'm doing now, now that I'm in my seventies, is turning around to help people, anybody that'll listen, and I want to help you.

Now, I've given away a lot of material. But most of the time people don't value what is given to them for nothing. It sits on the shelf or they just kinda look at it without any real investment of energy or attention. 

I've also sold a lot of packages that cost hundreds to thousands of dollars, and that kind of eliminated a lot of people who needed the material.

So it's the middle. The middle ground is what I'm offering you today.

I have three full length packages that I'm going to offer to you today and today only for $3.

And let me tell you what these three packages are. 

The first is the three day rule. What I discovered is that you will tend to manifest in your life what you're thinking about in three days.

Now, obviously that doesn't always happen, so why not?

It's because you keep changing your mind. You need to understand how the mind works.

I'm Matthew, we have helped auto shops market their business for 8 years and still do. However, as we all know another big problem in the industry since 2020 is hiring TECHS.

Quality A and B-Level Techs.

Jorge and I are in the picture below he is a 7-year client, now also a friend. I am on the left, Jorge and MANY of our clients were booked weeks out in 2020.

They all said the same thing, we have all the work we could ever want. NOW we need quality techs, some of our clients even paused their marketing until they could hire.

As you could imagine, this hurt our revenue...

After a few months of waiting for them to hire..

We learned hiring quality techs is not as easy as it once was.

We thought, why not try ourselves to fix this problem.

We would have to be creative because job boards or the traditional head-hunting was not working.

Our crazy idea was to run ads to get techs, similar to the marketing we had been doing for almost a decade.

We could fix this massive problem so many shops were facing.

Maybe it was selfish, if it worked we would unpause the marketing retainers.

Whatever the reason, we were MOTIVATED to fix this.

Well, we jumped in and were surprised by the results.

Our first try was with a long-time client in East Texas we landed 48 Technician applicants in 30 days, 4 hires after 2 months.

The next 28 applicants, 1 hire.

The next 32 - 2 hires

That roar stole my eighteenth birthday and shattered my world. My first shift should have been glory—blood turned blessing into shame. By dawn they'd branded me ""cursed"": cast out by my pack, abandoned by family, stripped of my nature. My father didn't defend me—he sent me to a forsaken island where wolfless outcasts were forged into weapons, forced to kill each other until only one could leave.
On that island I learned the darkest edges of humanity and how to bury terror in bone. Countless times I wanted to surrender—dive into the waves and never surface—but the accusing faces that haunted my dreams pushed me back toward something colder than survival: revenge. I escaped, and for three years I hid among humans, collecting secrets, learning to move like a shadow, sharpening patience into precision—becoming a blade.
Then, under a full moon, I touched a bleeding stranger—and my wolf returned with a violence that made me whole. Who was he? Why could he wake what I'd thought dead?

“Matteo, please.” My voice cracks like I’m some desperate teenager instead of a grown woman in a designer gown. “Just… look at me. Really look at me.” He doesn’t even glance up from adjusting his platinum cufflinks—the ones I bought him for our first anniversary.

The color brings out my dark eyes, makes my olive skin glow. At least, that’s what I used to think.

I have for two years now, and I just need to know if there’s any part of you that could—” “No.” One word. Two letters.

I almost drowned
Violet 

“Between you and me, Violet, if we both fell into the water, who do you think he’d save?” Nora asked, a wicked grin curling on her lips.

“What—” I barely got the word out before she turned toward the pool, her smile deepening. And without warning, she grabbed my hand and dragged us both under.

If your partner of four years and your childhood sweetheart both fell into a pool, and neither of them could swim, who would you save?

Who would you run to first without thinking?

Most men would say their girlfriend. That’s the obvious answer, isn’t it?

So why… why did Matthew run past me, his girlfriend, and dive straight toward her?

His childhood sweetheart.

“Nora!!” he screamed, jumping into the water. He reached her in seconds, pulling her limp body into his arms, and he carried her out of the water.

Water rushed into my mouth and nose before I could even scream. I tried to float, but my body refused. My arms flailed, my hands slapped against the surface, but I couldn’t stay up. I was sinking. 

And to make it worse, he didn’t even look back at me.

""Nora! Nora, wake up! Please, wake up!"" Matthew shouted, his voice cracking with desperation, as if he couldn’t imagine a world without her, as if she were the love of his life. And there I was, his girlfriend of four years, still struggling in the pool, about to die.

How ironic. Was I really going to die like this?

It was too cruel, embarrassing, and stupid.

People would talk. They’d whisper over my grave,

‘That’s the girl whose boyfriend let her drown to save another woman.’

 “Victorious warriors win first and then go to war.” — Sun Tzu

 

🏁 Win Before You Begin

This morning’s run reminded me of one thing — success doesn’t happen on the battlefield. It happens in preparation.

“Victorious warriors win first and then go to war.”

The greatest wins are internal. They’re decided in your habits, your mindset, your preparation — long before the moment of challenge arrives.

Every early morning run, every quiet hour of focus, every small decision to keep going — those are the unseen victories that make the visible ones inevitable.

You don’t rise to the occasion. You fall to your level of preparation.

💭 Reflection: Are you preparing for your moment — or waiting for it?

In her second year back, Elara's fingers brushed against a pregnancy report in Elias's suit pocket.

Elara's mind detonated.
Everyone knew Elias had once worshipped her, adored her to his very core.
Back then, she had arrived in this world on a mission from the System: to redeem Elias, to prevent his descent into darkness from triggering the world's collapse.
The first time Elara saw Elias, he was huddled in a corner of the House of Vance's basement, his wrists crisscrossed with self-inflicted wounds. The seventeen-year-old boy was so emaciated he was almost unrecognizable, and his eyes held a terrifying stillness.
The System's voice echoed in her mind: [WARNING! Target's Corruption Level: 99%. World Collapse Countdown: 30 Days].

Alpha Damien of the Crimson Pack. The most dangerous man I had ever laid eyes on.

You might have wondered why, if I had gone back nine times, I couldn’t stop it. Why I couldn’t change the ending. The truth was cruel.

My chest heaved. My hand clamped over the wound in my stomach, trying to hold in what was already spilling out. Around me, the battlefield was silent except for the groans of the dying. All my men were gone.

Damien towered over me, tall and merciless, his armor slick with blood. There wasn’t a scratch on him. His face was blank and emotionless as always, those cold blue eyes slicing into me without a hint of pity. He looked at me the way one looks at a wounded animal, seconds before delivering the final blow. The cold-blooded monster was about to end my life.

In the quiet town of Floraton, Whitney Eaton was curled on the sofa of her three-story villa, phone in hand. She wore light gray sweats, but there was nothing casual about her arresting beauty.

Her features were so finely carved they seemed like a work of art, and a natural coolness clung to her. Despite her youth, her deep eyes held a sharp, decisive look that felt years beyond her age.

Leaning back, she lowered her lashes, a flicker of mockery hidden in her gaze.

She paused for a moment, her voice cool and detached when she finally spoke. ""Tell the driver to wait for me outside the t."" Without waiting for a response, she ended the call.

""Whitney, has the Eaton family sent someone for you?"" An older man in a black suit descended the stairs. It was Hendrix, her mentor's buddy.

""Yeah, Hendrix. My stepmother's driver is already waiting outside of Floraton,"" Whitney replied, standing up to meet him.

It’s been far too long since I’ve seen that pretty scowl of yours. I wonder, does it deepen when you read my words? Do you bite that plush bottom lip, trying to hide the way I make you squirm?

My fiancé is gay.

That was the thought echoing through my head as I stood there frozen, watching a scene I could never unsee. I stared at the man thrusting into my fiancé’s ass, and at Charles moaning like a goddamn whore in heat.

This was my fiance, the man I was supposed to marry in five days. The man I had shared a bed, a future, a life with for five whole years. But he was there, legs spread wide, eyes rolled back in bliss I had never seen cross his face when he was with me.

I couldn’t breathe anymore, everywhere felt like it was spinning. The sound of skin slapping against skin filled the room. I wanted to look away, but I couldn’t. My eyes stayed locked, watching as if my brain couldn’t register that this was real.

“Ah, fuck, Mark… yes, I love this… fuck… you’re so big.” Charles moaned, and the words hit me like punches to the gut. 

My hand flew to my mouth, pressing hard to keep the nausea down. My heart felt like it had been torn from my chest and shoved down a garbage disposal. Was this a nightmare? Was I going to wake up in our apartment, beside him, with his arms around me and none of this real?

“Fuck yeah, Charles, baby,” the man grunted. “Take my big boy. Take him good.”

“Ah, daddy! Give me your big boy!!!”

Tears burned the back of my eyes. My knees buckled slightly, and I reached out to the doorframe for support. Daddy? He had never called me anything in bed. What was I saying? He had never seemed that interested in sex with me. Two minutes. That was the amount of minutes he took before he came. Anytime I asked him for more, he would say he was tired or he would just give me a disgusted look before leaving. 

My mind raced, spiraling out of control.

Is he gay? Bisexual? Has he always been like this? Had he been faking it with me? All these years? Every kiss, every time he said I love you, every plan we made for the future, was it all a lie?

I felt humiliated, sick, and like a goddamn fool.

This was my fiance, the man I was supposed to marry in five days. The man I had shared a bed, a future, a life with for five whole years. But he was there, legs spread wide, eyes rolled back in bliss I had never seen cross his face when he was with me.

I couldn’t breathe anymore, everywhere felt like it was spinning. The sound of skin slapping against skin filled the room. I wanted to look away, but I couldn’t. My eyes stayed locked, watching as if my brain couldn’t register that this was real.

“Ah, fuck, Mark… yes, I love this… fuck… you’re so big.” Charles moaned, and the words hit me like punches to the gut. 

My hand flew to my mouth, pressing hard to keep the nausea down. My heart felt like it had been torn from my chest and shoved down a garbage disposal. Was this a nightmare? Was I going to wake up in our apartment, beside him, with his arms around me and none of this real?

“Fuck yeah, Charles, baby,” the man grunted. “Take my big boy. Take him good.”

“Ah, daddy! Give me your big boy!!!”

Tears burned the back of my eyes. My knees buckled slightly, and I reached out to the doorframe for support. Daddy? He had never called me anything in bed. What was I saying? He had never seemed that interested in sex with me. Two minutes. That was the amount of minutes he took before he came. Anytime I asked him for more, he would say he was tired or he would just give me a disgusted look before leaving. 

My mind raced, spiraling out of control.

Is he gay? Bisexual? Has he always been like this? Had he been faking it with me? All these years? Every kiss, every time he said I love you, every plan we made for the future, was it all a lie?

I felt humiliated, sick, and like a goddamn fool.

In the firewood shed.

A girl, around fifteen or sixteen, curled up tightly, her body shaking uncontrollably as if trapped in a horrifying nightmare.

Her pale pink jacket was filthy beyond recognition.

The butterfly hairpin had long fallen off, and her tangled hair was covered in mud.

After struggling in the pile of firewood for a while, she suddenly jolted awake with a hoarse scream, ""It wasn't me! I swear it wasn't me!""

Her voice trailed off, and as she took in her surroundings, the terror in her eyes gradually gave way to confusion.

Hadn't she died?

Her eldest brother Joshua Wallen had cut out her tongue, her second brother Avery Wallen poisoned her, her fifth brother Andrew had severed her legs, her fourth brother Clyde had kicked her out, and she had taken a sword for Tessa.

In the end, her third brother Russell had tossed her body into the cold pond…

Why was she back in the firewood shed in the Chancellor's estate?

In her previous life, she had been locked up here for a full month, leaving her with severe rheumatism that tormented her for three long years.

She hadn't expected to be reborn.

As reality hit her, Margaery Wallen's pale face twisted into a bitter smile.

She was the daughter of the Chancellor's estate. Her mother had died during a difficult childbirth, and the midwife told her father Raul Wallen that only she had survived.

Being a preemie, weak and frail, and her mother's last memory, she became the family's prized possession.

The Moon Goddess did not tell me that on my 18th birthday, the gift she gave me was not my mate, but rather the devil.
My hands were shaking violently, and my heart hammered loudly against my chest as I held the phone that I just snatched from Asher. Disbelief slammed into me and my jaw dropped open as I watched the video playing on the phone.
It was a sex video of me…and Lucas.
Last night, in the forest behind the pack house, I gave my virginity to Lucas. He was the Alpha's son, the love of my life, my perfect boyfriend.
My first sexual experience didn't turn out to be great, it was pain. My body ached all over and I still felt sore from it.
But that hadn't matter to me yesterday. What mattered was that I had given Lucas what he wanted and my boyfriend had seemed to be happy.
But why was there a video? And how the h3ll did Asher have this video?
I took a deep breath, pushing past the sting of tears in my eyes as I looked up at Asher. He stepped back when he saw the anger in my eyes, and pointed to Ryan beside him.
“This has nothing to do with me. He shared the video in our chat group.”
My stomach swopped, and it was getting harder for me to breathe.
“Chat group?” I repeated.
Was Asher referring to the same chat group that included all the young people in out pack?
It couldn't be, right?
My hands were trembling badly now, and I was barely able to hold on to the damn phone. I turned to face Ryan.
Ryan raised his hands and took a step back.
“Wow. Don't look at me with such a terrifying stare. It was your boyfriend who sent the video to me. Who knew the Beta's daughter was actually a b1tch,” he smirked.
Condensation was heavy in his voice as he winked at me, but I didn't care.
My head was spinning from the weight of his confession. Before I could say anything though, someone interrupted us.

I stood in front of my dressing mirror, smoothing down the red silk dress that clung to every curve like it had been poured over my skin.

It was beautiful. Elegant. But too showy for a girl like me. I was the type who wore soft pastels, modest cuts, dresses that made me blend in instead of standing out.

Still, I smiled. “How do I look?”

He leaned against the wall across the room, arms crossed over his chest. A gray hoodie draped over his frame, sleeves shoved to his elbows.

His dark hair was a mess, the way it always was, like he’d just rolled out of bed and couldn’t care less.

His expression…unreadable. And those cold green eyes fixed on me like I was a problem he couldn’t solve.

I watched his gaze drag slow, from my hair to my waist, down to the hem puddling at my feet. He didn't blink at all.

“Take it off.”

My smile slipped, and with it, the dimples on my cheeks. In the mirror, my reflection stared back at me, lips parting. “What? You don’t think Luca would like—”

“No, he wouldn’t like it…” His voice was flat, low, and dangerous.

Then he pushed off the wall, crossing the space with steady, deliberate steps. The air shifted as he stopped behind me, heat rolling off his body.

His breath skimmed the shell of my ear as his fingers traced the curve of my spine, climbing the back of my dress until they found the zipper.

“…but I would. And what I’d love even more is seeing you without it.” His words rasped as his mouth dropped to my neck, leaving slow, open‑mouthed kisses down the side of it.

My head tipped to the side on instinct, exposing more of my skin to him, a soft moan slipping out as our eyes caught in the mirror. His were darker, hungrier, as if daring me to stop him when he already knew I wouldn’t.

But I knew I should. I needed to—before we went too far again, before I let happen what should never happen between us.

Do you know how many people in the company have misunderstood her? After your comment, how is she going to face her colleagues?""
I sneered: ""Looks like not everyone's blind. So some people know what she's up to.""
I stared at him, my voice steady: ""Besides, I'm not her mother. How hard she works in her career is none of my business.""
""What is it?"" Jonathan's face instantly darkened. ""Lindsay, when did you become such a shallow person who believes rumors and slanders outstanding women? You know how difficult it is for young women to succeed in the workplace, yet you still spread rumors and insult her? If you hadn't gone to the company to cause trouble last time, would Victoria be in this situation?"" His eyes were tired yet accusatory. 
""I don't mind if you're willing to depend on someone else; I'm willing to give you a comfortable life. But not all women are like you... limited. If you continue to harbor malice towards Victoria and speak ill of her, don't blame me for being ruthless. Think of your mother.""

Lucas was there. My husband of six years. Undressed.
There was also a woman beneath him.
Olivia Parker. My best friend.
I gagged, trying so hard to be quiet as tears started to fall.
Her nails dug into Lucas’s back, her head tilted, her voice loud enough to carry through the phone’s speaker.
“Tell me you love me more than her,” she said, breathless, her gaze lifting straight into the camera.
Lucas laughed. Low. Indulgent. 
“Harper?” he said, his hand slid up her throat. “She’s for optics. The wife the board likes. You’re the one I actually want.”
The words landed cleanly. No hesitation. No humor to soften them.
I felt my fingers go numb around the stem of my glass.
At the bottom corner of the screen, a number ticked upward. 187. 188. 189.
Each digit a tiny, tearing my heart apart.

The auctioneer’s voice carried across the ballroom, smooth and practiced, rising and falling with the rhythm of money being pledged for a cause no one here truly needed to believe in.

I felt my fingers go numb around the stem of my glass.

The auctioneer’s voice carried across the ballroom, smooth and practiced, rising and falling with the rhythm of money being pledged for a cause no one here truly needed to believe in. Crystal chandeliers scattered light across silk gowns and tailored tuxedos. Laughter floated easily. Applause came on cue. Everything about the night was polished, expensive, and carefully staged.
My phone vibrated inside my clutch.
Once.
I ignored it at first. Everyone did, in rooms like this. Etiquette mattered more than urgency. Then it vibrated again, the faint hum sharp against my palm, persistent enough to pull my attention away from the stage.

You deserve to know what your husband is really paying for.
I stared at the words longer than necessary, my pulse slowing instead of spiking. Messages like that were usually nothing. Blackmail attempts. Bored guests looking for drama. The k | I witnessed my best friend riding my husband's shaft on a live stream.
Several minutes ago, I received a message at the auction-you should know who your husband is having an affair with.
There was a link beneath the sentence.
My stomach drops. I tapped it. The livestream loaded instantly. 
Lucas was there. My husband of six years. Undressed.
There was also a woman beneath him.
Olivia Parker. My best friend.
I gagged, trying so hard to be quiet as tears started to fall.
Her nails dug into Lucas’s back, her head tilted, her voice loud enough to carry through the phone’s speaker.
“Tell me you love me more than her,” she said, breathless, her gaze lifting straight into the camera.
Lucas laughed. Low. Indulgent.

But on the day of my stepfather’s funeral, I found him buried between another woman’s thighs. That same night, my mother collapsed. No money. No way out. No one to turn to— Except him. Nikolai Vetrov. My ex’s older brother. A billionaire with ice in his veins and sin in his smile. A man who hates his brother just as much as I do now. 
So I walked into his office with a deal. ""Marry me. Give me enough money to save mom. I’ll give you a wife on paper and nothing more.""

Chapter 1
My heart plummets.

My fists clench at my sides, nails biting into my palms as I stare, frozen, at the scene before me.

The room reeks of sweat and sex, I can’t help but tremble.

And there he is.

Dmitri.

My fiancé.

The man I was supposed to marry.

Groveling at my feet, tangled in his own damn pants as he fumbles to cover himself. His face is pale, his hair disheveled, his lips—those same lips that whispered loving words into my ears—swollen from kissing someone else.

A woman—a stranger—lays half-naked on the bed behind him, the silk sheets tangled around her body as she scrambles away like a cornered animal. Her eyes dart to mine in wide-eyed panic before she clutches the blanket to her chest and bolts toward the bathroom, slamming the door shut.

Coward.

Dmitri stares up at me, panic laced in his voice. ""Elena—it's not what it looks like.""

A hollow laugh escapes me. Cold. Emotionless. Clearly the laugh of a woman who has lost everything.

I take a step closer, my heels clicking against the polished hardwood floor. I feel detached from my own body, as if I'm watching this play out from somewhere far, far away.

""Not what it looks like?"" I repeat softly, tilting my head.

“What—” I barely got the word out before she turned toward the pool, her smile deepening. And without warning, she grabbed my hand and dragged us both under.

None of them were enough to mask the shock I still felt as I stared at the screen before me.

I saw my husband, Dylan, his hands gripping Crystal’s neck in pleasure unlike the same way they always gripped mine whenever I spoke out of term. He kissed her with passion, leaving red marks on her naked back, different from the bruises he gave me, which came from his anger whenever he punched me for any slight mistake.

Quickly forcing all thoughts out and wiping away the tears that were seconds from falling, I focused on the door.

The only solution to stop this constant pain was right behind it and all I had to do was turn the knob then the door suddenly swung open just as I reached for it forcing me to collide with a wall.

I stumbled backwards, my legs giving out and I crumbled to the floor looking up to see the wall.

Then I saw him.

The answer.

His cold gray eyes stared back at me pinning me to the ground. It didn’t matter how many of his pictures I had seen, I was not prepared to be physically hit with how beautiful he was.

Grayson Blackwood.

The Alpha King.

His eyes locked onto mine, and for a split second, everything stopped. The world around me faded, and all that existed was his gaze—sharp, assessing, and impossibly cold.

With the last ounce of strength I had, I bowed my head, kneeling at his feet. “Please,” I rasped, my voice raw and broken. “Please, Alpha King… help me.”

“Ava.” I heard Dylan, my husband growl from the side, stepping towards us and I couldn't help but notice the stark difference between the two men before me.

Dylan's stare, though equally cold, burned with an intensity that made me want to shrink back. It was the kind of look that held a thousand unspoken threats, and I knew each one by heart.

""I agree to marry you."" Outside the city hall, Britney Santos stared at the already closed doors, pulled out her phone, and dialed a number.

Today was supposed to be the day she and Aaron Galloway got their marriage license.

But she'd waited from nine in the morning until five-thirty in the afternoon, ending up with over a dozen queue tickets clutched in her hand. Aaron never showed.

He was the one who'd suggested getting married, and he was the one who'd stood her up. This was already the third time he'd flaked on her.

Britney tossed the useless tickets into the trash, turned on her heel, and called her longtime rival, Fredrick Pollard.

She still remembered how, the first time she'd been ditched here, Fredrick had straight-up asked her to marry him instead. But she'd turned him down.

The second time played out the same way.

This morning, Fredrick messaged her about marriage again. And this time, she said yes.

Just a moment ago, she'd spotted a post in her social media feed. It was from Aaron's old flame, his crush.

In the photo, Aaron sat ramrod straight, meticulously slicing an apple, with the caption: [Whenever I need him, he's always there. That's true favoritism, the kind of confidence only he can give me.]

Britney let out a self-mocking smirk, gave it a casual like, and commented: [Locked in forever. Wishing you eternal bliss.]

To her surprise, her heart felt completely at peace.

In the past, she would've screenshot it immediately and confronted Aaron, demanding to know what the hell it meant. It would've sparked a huge fight. And it always ended with him slamming the door on his way out.

But now, she didn't even feel like getting angry. She was truly done with Aaron.

The voice on the other end snapped her back to reality. ""I'm on a business trip. I'll be back in a week. If you're still up for it, meet me at the city hall at nine.""

“Do you plan on making me wait all morning, Auren?” Maris’s sharp voice cut through my thoughts like a whip as I entered the dining room.

Maris was Alpha Bram’s betrothed. He was thirty-three years old and still unmated. Maris was twenty-seven and daughter of the Alpha of Iron Pine pack. They had met each other in the annual mating ball about a year ago.

“I’m sorry,” I mumbled, bowing my head. Her dark, carefully fashioned curls shimmered in the sunlight filtering through the wide windows of the dining hall, and her perfectly manicured nails tapped against the table impatiently. Everyone knew Maris would be the Luna soon. She carried herself like it, with a sharp tongue and a sharper glare.

She narrowed her eyes at the tray in my hands. “Where’s my almond latte? I specifically asked for it.”

“It’s coming, Maris—” I stopped myself, flinching. “I’ll get it right away.”

Her lips curved into a cruel sneer. “See that you do. I’d hate to have to | Due to his unique biology, he needed a woman every month to put out the fire. This time, they sent him a damaged Omega.

*****

In the firewood shed.

A girl, around fifteen or sixteen, curled up tightly, her body shaking uncontrollably as if trapped in a horrifying nightmare.

Her pale pink jacket was filthy beyond recognition.

The butterfly hairpin had long fallen off, and her tangled hair was covered in mud.

After struggling in the pile of firewood for a while, she suddenly jolted awake with a hoarse scream, ""It wasn't me! I swear it wasn't me!""

Her voice trailed off, and as she took in her surroundings, the terror in her eyes gradually gave way to confusion.

Hadn't she died?

Her eldest brother Joshua Wallen had cut out her tongue, her second brother Avery Wallen poisoned her, her fifth brother Andrew had severed her legs, her fourth brother Clyde had kicked her out, and she had taken a sword for Tessa.

In the end, her third brother Russell had tossed her body into the cold pond…

Why was she back in the firewood shed in the Chancellor's estate?

In her previous life, she had been locked up here for a full month, leaving her with severe rheumatism that tormented her for three long years.

She hadn't expected to be reborn.

As reality hit her, Margaery Wallen's pale face twisted into a bitter smile.

She was the daughter of the Chancellor's estate. Her mother had died during a difficult childbirth, and the midwife told her father Raul Wallen that only she had survived.

Being a preemie, weak and frail, and her mother's last memory, she became the family's prized possession.

“Between you and me, Violet, if we both fell into the water, who do you think he’d save?” Nora asked, a wicked grin curling on her lips.

“What—” I barely got the word out before she turned toward the pool, her smile deepening. And without warning, she grabbed my hand and dragged us both under.

If your partner of four years and your childhood sweetheart both fell into a pool, and neither of them could swim, who would you save?

“Nora!!” he screamed, jumping into the water. He reached her in seconds, pulling her limp body into his arms, and he carried her out of the water.

Water rushed into my mouth and nose before I could even scream. I tried to float, but my body refused. My arms flailed, my hands slapped against the surface, but I couldn’t stay up. I was sinking. 

And to make it worse, he didn’t even look back at me.

""Nora! Nora, wake up! Please, wake up!"" Matthew shouted, his voice cracking with desperation, as if he couldn’t imagine a world without her, as if she were the love of his life. And there I was, his girlfriend of four years, still struggling in the pool, about to die.

How ironic. Was I really going to die like this?

It was too cruel, embarrassing, and stupid.

People would talk. They’d whisper over my grave,

Gracie

My fiancé is gay.

That was the thought echoing through my head as I stood there frozen, watching a scene I could never unsee. I stared at the man thrusting into my fiancé’s ass, and at Charles moaning like a goddamn whore in heat.

This was my fiance, the man I was supposed to marry in five days. The man I had shared a bed, a future, a life with for five whole years. But he was there, legs spread wide, eyes rolled back in bliss I had never seen cross his face when he was with me.

I couldn’t breathe anymore, everywhere felt like it was spinning. The sound of skin slapping against skin filled the room. I wanted to look away, but I couldn’t. My eyes stayed locked, watching as if my brain couldn’t register that this was real.

“Ah, fuck, Mark… yes, I love this… fuck… you’re so big.” Charles moaned, and the words hit me like punches to the gut. 

My hand flew to my mouth, pressing hard to keep the nausea down. My heart felt like it had been torn from my chest and shoved down a garbage disposal. Was this a nightmare? Was I going to wake up in our apartment, beside him, with his arms around me and none of this real?

“Fuck yeah, Charles, baby,” the man grunted. “Take my big boy. Take him good.”

“Ah, daddy! Give me your big boy!!!”

Tears burned the back of my eyes. My knees buckled slightly, and I reached out to the doorframe for support. Daddy? He had never called me anything in bed. What was I saying? He had never seemed that interested in sex with me. Two minutes. That was the amount of minutes he took before he came. Anytime I asked him for more, he would say he was tired or he would just give me a disgusted look before leaving. 

My mind raced, spiraling out of control.

Is he gay? Bisexual? Has he always been like this? Had he been faking it with me? All these years? Every kiss, every time he said I love you, every plan we made for the future, was it all a lie?

I felt humiliated, sick, and like a goddamn fool.

How do women process this?  | My fiancé is gay
Gracie

My fiancé is gay.

That was the thought echoing through my head as I stood there frozen, watching a scene I could never unsee. I stared at the man thrusting into my fiancé’s ass, and at Charles moaning like a goddamn whore in heat.

This was my fiance, the man I was supposed to marry in five days. The man I had shared a bed, a future, a life with for five whole years. But he was there, legs spread wide, eyes rolled back in bliss I had never seen cross his face when he was with me.

I couldn’t breathe anymore, everywhere felt like it was spinning. The sound of skin slapping against skin filled the room. I wanted to look away, but I couldn’t. My eyes stayed locked, watching as if my brain couldn’t register that this was real.

“Ah, fuck, Mark… yes, I love this… fuck… you’re so big.” Charles moaned, and the words hit me like punches to the gut. 

My hand flew to my mouth, pressing hard to keep the nausea down. My heart felt like it had been torn from my chest and shoved down a garbage disposal. Was this a nightmare? Was I going to wake up in our apartment, beside him, with his arms around me and none of this real?

“Fuck yeah, Charles, baby,” the man grunted. “Take my big boy. Take him good.”

“Ah, daddy! Give me your big boy!!!”

Tears burned the back of my eyes. My knees buckled slightly, and I reached out to the doorframe for support. Daddy? He had never called me anything in bed. What was I saying? He had never seemed that interested in sex with me. Two minutes. That was the amount of minutes he took before he came. Anytime I asked him for more, he would say he was tired or he would just give me a disgusted look before leaving. 

My mind raced, spiraling out of control.

Chapter 1 Pregnant
""One more round?"" Easton Foster whispered, his lips brushing against Sophia Roth's ear, his voice low and taunting.

""Get off me..."" Sophia winced at the sting between her thighs and pushed against his chest.

""Isn't this exactly what you wanted? Using Grandma to force me back so I'd play the dutiful husband? Fine. Let's keep going. They're all outside listening,"" Easton sneered.

""Easton, you're an asshole,"" Sophia shot back, her face flushed with both anger and shame.

""An asshole? Remember how this marriage even came about? Don't talk to me about fairness."" Easton's voice was cold and mocking. Before Sophia could react, he crushed his lips to hers, hard and demanding.

The kiss sent heat spiraling through Sophia. Her mind blanked, every word he'd just said dissolving, and she forgot to resist.

Easton despised their marriage. Just one day after their wedding, he bailed on Jenston and jetted off to Menolia for business at the Foster Group branch. He was gone for ten whole months, and Sophia became the hottest joke among all of Jenston's elite families.

Everyone knew Sophia wasn't really Easton's wife in his eyes, and she was just there to fill the role, nothing more than a title with no meaning. Sophia knew the only reason he showed up this time was because his grandmother, Irene, faked an illness.

She'd daydreamed about their wedding night. But not once did she imagine it'd turn out like that—Easton's every move was harsh and fierce, fueled by bitterness, and her feelings didn't matter to him at all. She shut her eyes, tears streaming silently from the corners.

The scene burned into my retinas like a brand. Sophia bent over her dresser; her gold dress pushed up around her waist. Ryan was behind her, his pants around his ankles, hands gripping her hips as he thrust into her.

Olivia's POV

I slumped against the passenger seat as Ryan's car cruised through the palm-lined streets of Los Angeles.

My eyelids felt heavy after a twelve-hour shift at Carter Enterprises. The quarterly marketing campaign required us all to work overtime, and as a junior marketing executive, I was stuck with weekend work.

""You still with me, babe?"" Ryan glanced over, his perfectly styled dark hair catching the sunset's glow.

""Barely."" I stifled a yawn. ""Remind me why we're going to this party when I could be face-planting into my pillow right now?""

""Because Sophia would kill you if you missed her birthday."" He reached over and squeezed my knee. ""And because you look stunning in that dress I bought for you.""

I glanced down at the black cocktail dress he'd insisted I wear. The neckline plunged lower than I'd normally choose, and the hemline rode high enough to make me self-conscious every time I sat down.

Ryan had shown up at my apartment with the dress in a boutique bag, eyes gleaming with anticipation as I'd tried it on.

""I still think it's a bit much for a birthday party,"" I tugged at the fabric, trying to cover more of my chest.

The scene burned into my retinas like a brand. Sophia bent over her dresser; her gold dress pushed up around her waist. Ryan was behind her, his pants around his ankles, hands gripping her hips as he thrust into her.
""Harder,"" Sophia gasped. ""Make me feel it tomorrow.""
""What?"" The words escaped me before I could stop them.
They both froze. Ryan's head whipped around, his eyes widening with shock.

Olivia's POV

I slumped against the passenger seat as Ryan's car cruised through the palm-lined streets of Los Angeles.

My eyelids felt heavy after a twelve-hour shift at Carter Enterprises. The quarterly marketing campaign required us all to work overtime, and as a junior marketing executive, I was stuck with weekend work.

""You still with me, babe?"" Ryan glanced over, his perfectly styled dark hair catching the sunset's glow.

""Barely."" I stifled a yawn. ""Remind me why we're going to this party when I could be face-planting into my pillow right now?""

""Because Sophia would kill you if you missed her birthday."" He reached over and squeezed my knee. ""And because you look stunning in that dress I bought for you.""

I glanced down at the black cocktail dress he'd insisted I wear. The neckline plunged lower than I'd normally choose, and the hemline rode high enough to make me self-conscious every time I sat down.

Ryan had shown up at my apartment with the dress in a boutique bag, eyes gleaming with anticipation as I'd tried it on.

""I still think it's a bit much for a birthday party,"" I tugged at the fabric, trying to cover more of my chest.

""Liv, we've been dating  | 💔A sound caught my attention. A woman's moan, breathless and urgent: ""Yes, right there.""
I froze. The voice was familiar.
A male voice responded, low and commanding: ""You like that, don't you? Tell me how much you want it.""
My stomach dropped. Ryan's voice.

Concealers.

Scarfs.

Smiles.

None of them were enough to mask the shock I still felt as I stared at the screen before me.

I saw my husband, Dylan, his hands gripping Crystal’s neck in pleasure unlike the same way they always gripped mine whenever I spoke out of term. He kissed her with passion, leaving red marks on her naked back, different from the bruises he gave me, which came from his anger whenever he punched me for any slight mistake.

Quickly forcing all thoughts out and wiping away the tears that were seconds from falling, I focused on the door.

The only solution to stop this constant pain was right behind it and all I had to do was turn the knob then the door suddenly swung open just as I reached for it forcing me to collide with a wall.

I stumbled backwards, my legs giving out and I crumbled to the floor looking up to see the wall.

Then I saw him.

The answer.

His cold gray eyes stared back at me pinning me to the ground. It didn’t matter how many of his pictures I had seen, I was not prepared to be physically hit with how beautiful he was.

Grayson Blackwood.

The Alpha King.

His eyes locked onto mine, and for a split second, everything stopped. The world around me faded, and all that existed was his gaze—sharp, assessing, and impossibly cold.

With the last ounce of strength I had, I bowed my head, kneeling at his feet. “Please,” I rasped, my voice raw and broken. “Please, Alpha King… help me.”

“Ava.” I heard Dylan, my husband growl from the side, stepping towards us and I couldn't help but notice the stark difference between the two men before me.

•~•Lola's POV

I stood in front of my dressing mirror, smoothing down the red silk dress that clung to every curve like it had been poured over my skin.

It was beautiful. Elegant. But too showy for a girl like me. I was the type who wore soft pastels, modest cuts, dresses that made me blend in instead of standing out.

Still, I smiled. “How do I look?”

He leaned against the wall across the room, arms crossed over his chest. A gray hoodie draped over his frame, sleeves shoved to his elbows.

His dark hair was a mess, the way it always was, like he’d just rolled out of bed and couldn’t care less.

His expression…unreadable. And those cold green eyes fixed on me like I was a problem he couldn’t solve.

I watched his gaze drag slow, from my hair to my waist, down to the hem puddling at my feet. He didn't blink at all.

“Take it off.”

My smile slipped, and with it, the dimples on my cheeks. In the mirror, my reflection stared back at me, lips parting. “What? You don’t think Luca would like—”

“No, he wouldn’t like it…” His voice was flat, low, and dangerous.

Then he pushed off the wall, crossing the space with steady, deliberate steps. The air shifted as he stopped behind me, heat rolling off his body.

His breath skimmed the shell of my ear as his fingers traced the curve of my spine, climbing the back of my dress until they found the zipper.

“…but I would. And what I’d love even more is seeing you without it.” His words rasped as his mouth dropped to my neck, leaving slow, open‑mouthed kisses down the side of it.

My head tipped to the side on instinct, exposing more of my skin to him, a soft moan slipping out as our eyes caught in the mirror. His were darker, hungrier, as if daring me to stop him when he already knew I wouldn’t.

But I knew I should. I needed to—before we went too far again, before I let happen what should never happen between us.

He was surrounded by bodyguards, his presence a dark magnet in the chaos. I felt like a ghost in this place, an Italian outsider in a den of predators, but fvck it, I was done being perfect. I pushed through the crowd, my heart hammering against my ribs. Ton1ght, I needed to be someone else, to feel alive before my life ended in a stranger's bed.

I stopped before him, forcing my voice steady. 'I want to experience dark things.' His gaze raked over me, cold and @ssessing. I swallowed hard, the air thick with unspoken threats. 'I'm tired of control. I want to lose myself, to be owned.'

Dante leaned in, his breath hot on my ear. 'If you come home with me ton1ght, you need to understand som3thing. I don’t do gentle. I don’t do sweet. I don’t do making love.' My breath hitched, but I didn’t pull away. 'What I do,' he continued, leaning closer until his mouth was inches from my ear, 'is bondage. I discipline. I possess. I f@ck. I push limits until they break, and then I push a little further.'

'I understand.'

'You do?' He pulled back to look at me. 'Once we leave this place, once I get you alone, I’ll not be asking you that. You’ll be mine for the n1ght, completely and utterly. Your pleasure, your pain, your fvcking breath—it all belongs to me until morning. And the only thing I’ll expect from you in return is submission. Utter fvcking submission.' I swallowed hard, my pulse racing in my throat. But when I spoke, my voice was steady. 'I want that.'

He led me out, his hand possessive on my arm, and we drove to his penthouse in silence. The elevator ascended too fast, my stomach lurching. When the doors opened, I gasped.

He was surrounded by bodyguards, his presence a dark magnet in the chaos. I felt like a ghost in this place, an Italian outsider in a den of predators, but fvck it, I was done being perfect. I pushed through the crowd, my heart hammering against my ribs. Ton1ght, I needed to be someone else, to feel alive before my life ended in a stranger's bed.

I push limits until they break, and then I push a little further.'

'I understand.'

'You do?' He pulled back to look at me. 'Once we leave this place, once I get you alone, I’ll not be asking you that. You’ll be mine for the n1ght, completely and utterly.

I had died nine times. And every single time, it had been by his hand.

Alpha Damien of the Crimson Pack. The most dangerous man I had ever laid eyes on.

The scene had always begun the same way, his sword pressed to my throat, his cold blue eyes pinning me where I knelt. The final strike had always come, his blade slicing through flesh, blood spilling down my chest as I drew my last breath.

You might have wondered why, if I had gone back nine times, I couldn’t stop it. Why I couldn’t change the ending. The truth was cruel. I remembered nothing of my past lives until that very moment, until I saw Damien’s blade at my throat. That was when it all crashed back, the nine deaths, my life flashing before my eyes, again and again.

My chest heaved. My hand clamped over the wound in my stomach, trying to hold in what was already spilling out. Around me, the battlefield was silent except for the groans of the dying. All my men were gone.

Damien towered over me, tall and merciless, his armor slick with blood. There wasn’t a scratch on him. His face was blank and emotionless as always, those cold blue eyes slicing into me without a hint of pity. He looked at me the way one looks at a wounded animal, seconds before delivering the final blow. The cold-blooded monster was about to end my life.

“Aww,” someone jeered behind him, a faceless soldier who had watched me die too many times. “She is still fighting to live. How sad.”

Another soldier laughed. “Hahaha. Sad indeed. The mighty Luna, leading her people into war, while her mate sits in his castle, drinking and fucking his pleasures. How dumb is she?”

A third voice chimed in. “Do we even need to kill her? Look at her. She’s beautiful. We could take her back, keep her as our slave. Imagine that, the Luna of Mooncrest on her knees for us.”

""An asshole? Remember how this marriage even came about? Don't talk to me about fairness."" Easton's voice was cold and mocking. Before Sophia could react, he crushed his lips to hers, hard and demanding.

The kiss sent heat spiraling through Sophia. Her mind blanked, every word he'd just said dissolving, and she forgot to resist.

Easton despised their marriage. Just one day after their wedding, he bailed on Jenston and jetted off to Menolia for business at the Foster Group branch. He was gone for ten whole months, and Sophia became the hottest joke among all of Jenston's elite families.

She'd daydreamed about their wedding night. But not once did she imagine it'd turn out like that—Easton's every move was harsh and fierce, fueled by bitterness, and her feelings didn't matter to him at all. She shut her eyes, tears streaming silently from the corners.

The morning air was cool as I hurried through the pack house, balancing a tray of breakfast plates. The faint smell of caramel and freshly brewed coffee wafted through the halls, but it did little to soothe the anxiety brewing in my chest. Today was my birthday—my eighteenth—the day I would smell my mate who would take me away from this cursed life. Life as an orphan omega in our pack was riddled with hardships and misery.

“Do you plan on making me wait all morning, Auren?” Maris’s sharp voice cut through my thoughts like a whip as I entered the dining room.

My stomach drops. I tapped it. The livestream loaded instantly. 
Lucas was there. My husband of six years. Undressed.
There was also a woman beneath him.
Olivia Parker. My best friend.
I gagged, trying so hard to be quiet as tears started to fall.
Her nails dug into Lucas’s back, her head tilted, her voice loud enough to carry through the phone’s speaker.
“Tell me you love me more than her,” she said, breathless, her gaze lifting straight into the camera.
Lucas laughed. Low. Indulgent. 
“Harper?” he said, his hand slid up her throat. “She’s for optics. The wife the board likes. You’re the one I actually want.”
The words landed cleanly. No hesitation. No humor to soften them.
I felt my fingers go numb around the stem of my glass.
At the bottom corner of the screen, a number ticked upward. 187. 188. 189.
Each digit a tiny, tearing my heart apart.
————————
The auctioneer’s voice carried across the ballroom, smooth and practiced, rising and falling with the rhythm of money being pledged for a cause no one here truly needed to believe in. Crystal chandeliers scattered light across silk gowns and tailored tuxedos. Laughter floated easily. Applause came on cue. Everything about the night was polished, expensive, and carefully staged.
My phone vibrated inside my clutch.
Once.
I ignored it at first. Everyone did, in rooms like this. Etiquette mattered more than urgency. Then it vibrated again, the faint hum sharp against my palm, persistent enough to pull my attention away from the stage.
Unknown number. One message.
You deserve to know what your husband is really paying for.
I stared at the words longer than necessary, my pulse slowing instead of spiking. Messages like that were usually nothing. Blackmail attempts. Bored guests looking for drama. The k | I witnessed my best friend riding my husband's shaft on a live stream.

""An asshole? Remember how this marriage even came about? Don't talk to me about fairness."" Easton's voice was cold and mocking. Before Sophia could react, he crushed his lips to hers, hard and demanding.
The kiss sent heat spiraling through Sophia. Her mind blanked, every word he'd just said dissolving, and she forgot to resist.
Easton despised their marriage. Just one day after their wedding, he bailed on Jenston and jetted off to Menolia for business at the Foster Group branch. He was gone for ten whole months, and Sophia became the hottest joke among all of Jenston's elite families.
Everyone knew Sophia wasn't really Easton's wife in his eyes, and she was just there to fill the role, nothing more than a title with no meaning. Sophia knew the only reason he showed up this time was because his grandmother, Irene, faked an illness.
She'd daydreamed about their wedding night. But not once did she imagine it'd turn out like that—Easton's every move was harsh and fierce, fueled by bitterness, and her feelings didn't matter to him at all. She shut her eyes, tears streaming silently from the corners.

""I agree to marry you."" Outside the city hall, Britney Santos stared at the already closed doors, pulled out her phone, and dialed a number.

Today was supposed to be the day she and Aaron Galloway got their marriage license.

But she'd waited from nine in the morning until five-thirty in the afternoon, ending up with over a dozen queue tickets clutched in her hand. Aaron never showed.

He was the one who'd suggested getting married, and he was the one who'd stood her up. This was already the third time he'd flaked on her.

Britney tossed the useless tickets into the trash, turned on her heel, and called her longtime rival, Fredrick Pollard.

She still remembered how, the first time she'd been ditched here, Fredrick had straight-up asked her to marry him instead. But she'd turned him down.

The second time played out the same way.

This morning, Fredrick messaged her about marriage again. And this time, she said yes.

Just a moment ago, she'd spotted a post in her social media feed. It was from Aaron's old flame, his crush.

In the photo, Aaron sat ramrod straight, meticulously slicing an apple, with the caption: [Whenever I need him, he's always there. That's true favoritism, the kind of confidence only he can give me.]

Britney let out a self-mocking smirk, gave it a casual like, and commented: [Locked in forever. Wishing you eternal bliss.]

To her surprise, her heart felt completely at peace.

In the past, she would've screenshot it immediately and confronted Aaron, demanding to know what the hell it meant. It would've sparked a huge fight. And it always ended with him slamming the door on his way out.

But now, she didn't even feel like getting angry. She was truly done with Aaron.

The voice on the other end snapped her back to reality. ""I'm on a business trip. I'll be back in a week. If you're still up for it, meet me at the city hall at nine.""

“You look perfect, Princess Katerina.”
My fists clenched tightly in my lap. I had to make a conscious effort to breathe and calm myself.
Perfect. I looked like a doll. The kind meant for display, pristine and never touched. The useless kind. Pale porcelain skin with the finest makeup applied so expertly that it looked seamless. Big blue eyes with lashes that didn’t need extensions. Plump red lips with the usual polite smile.
“Thank you,” I answered, nodding at the makeup artist.
“They’re waiting for you downstairs. Should I call your brother to accompany you?”
My fists balled again. Lordswood Castle was more secure than any fortress. Bugs couldn’t get in without stringent vetting and permission, but even that wouldn’t be enough to get them into the inner keep.
Yet they still accompanied me everywhere like a child.
Still, all of this was for a good reason. Every sacrifice would be worth it in the end.
“That won’t be necessary. Thank you, Alanna,” I said as I stood.
“But the Alpha said—”
“I’m sure I’ll be fine,” I interrupted, maintaining the smile so deeply ingrained in me it felt fused to my face.
I straightened the long skirt of my dress and adjusted my posture, although this was easy to do thanks to the corset. It was as stiff as a board; I couldn’t slouch even if I wanted to.
Only sparing a glance in the mirror, I nodded at the team of women who’d dressed me and headed out of my dressing room. I did look perfect, I had to give them that. Not a single strand of blonde hair out of place, shoulders straight, head held high. And every piece of clothing on my body was worth more than most people made in a year.
I was the prize.
The one raised to be envied. To complete my true mate’s life. To be a trophy.

That roar stole my eighteenth birthday and shattered my world. My first shift should have been glory—blood turned blessing into shame. By dawn they'd branded me ""cursed"": cast out by my pack, abandoned by family, stripped of my nature. My father didn't defend me—he sent me to a forsaken island where wolfless outcasts were forged into weapons, forced to kill each other until only one could leave.
On that island I learned the darkest edges of humanity and how to bury terror in bone.

I escaped, and for three years I hid among humans, collecting secrets, learning to move like a shadow, sharpening patience into precision—becoming a blade.
Then, under a full moon, I touched a bleeding stranger—and my wolf returned with a violence that made me whole. Who was he? Why could he wake what I'd thought dead?

I had died nine times. And every single time, it had been by his hand.

Alpha Damien of the Crimson Pack. The most dangerous man I had ever laid eyes on.

The scene had always begun the same way, his sword pressed to my throat, his cold blue eyes pinning me where I knelt. The final strike had always come, his blade slicing through flesh, blood spilling down my chest as I drew my last breath.

You might have wondered why, if I had gone back nine times, I couldn’t stop it. Why I couldn’t change the ending. The truth was cruel. I remembered nothing of my past lives until that very moment, until I saw Damien’s blade at my throat. That was when it all crashed back, the nine deaths, my life flashing before my eyes, again and again.

My chest heaved. My hand clamped over the wound in my stomach, trying to hold in what was already spilling out. Around me, the battlefield was silent except for the groans of the dying. All my men were gone.

Damien towered over me, tall and merciless, his armor slick with blood. There wasn’t a scratch on him. His face was blank and emotionless as always, those cold blue eyes slicing into me without a hint of pity. He looked at me the way one looks at a wounded animal, seconds before delivering the final blow. The cold-blooded monster was about to end my life.

“Aww,” someone jeered behind him, a faceless soldier who had watched me die too many times. “She is still fighting to live. How sad.”

Another soldier laughed. “Hahaha. Sad indeed. The mighty Luna, leading her people into war, while her mate sits in his castle, drinking and fucking his pleasures. How dumb is she?”

Marilyn’s POV

If you had asked me a week ago what the worst thing that could happen at Christmas was, I would’ve said something basic.

Like missing the last bus.

Or burning the turkey.

Maybe getting dumped over text.

I would not have said “catching your boyfriend of five years having sex with the woman he swore was his mother.”

But here we are.

I was smiling when I opened his apartment door. That’s the part that sticks in my head the most. I was still holding the little box of gingerbread cookies I’d baked with my mom’s dented tins, still rehearsing a cheesy speech about how this Christmas could be “our new beginning.” I remember thinking I should’ve worn lipstick. I remember nudging the door with my hip because my hands were full.

That was when I heard it.

The kind of sound you’re not supposed to hear coming from the person you love. The kind of sound that makes your brain lock up for a second, because it doesn’t fit with the picture you built in your head of them.

His voice was low and breathless. And then words that burned themselves into my skull.

“She’s nothing, baby. Just a placeholder. She's too dull to go anywhere.”

I wish I could say I dropped the cookies in dramatic slow motion, but I didn’t. I just stood there in the doorway like a badly written extra while the universe rewrote my entire life.

The woman beneath him—her dark hair spread over his sheets, nails clawing his back—laughed softly, almost indulgently. I’d seen her before, at the café across from campus, at family events. Always with that intense, too-intimate vibe. He told me she was overprotective, that their “mother-son” relationship freaked people out but it was just a cultural thing. I’d tried to believe him. I hadn’t been able to shake the feeling that they were… off, but I’d pushed it down.

Seeing them naked together removed any room for doubt.

""One more round?"" Easton Foster whispered, his lips brushing against Sophia Roth's ear, his voice low and taunting.
""Get off me..."" Sophia winced at the sting between her thighs and pushed against his chest.
""Isn't this exactly what you wanted? Using Grandma to force me back so I'd play the dutiful husband? Fine. Let's keep going. They're all outside listening,"" Easton sneered.
""Easton, you're an asshole,"" Sophia shot back, her face flushed with both anger and shame.
""An asshole? Remember how this marriage even came about? Don't talk to me about fairness."" Easton's voice was cold and mocking. Before Sophia could react, he crushed his lips to hers, hard and demanding.
The kiss sent heat spiraling through Sophia. Her mind blanked, every word he'd just said dissolving, and she forgot to resist.
Easton despised their marriage. Just one day after their wedding, he bailed on Jenston and jetted off to Menolia for business at the Foster Group branch. He was gone for ten whole months, and Sophia became the hottest joke among all of Jenston's elite families.
Everyone knew Sophia wasn't really Easton's wife in his eyes, and she was just there to fill the role, nothing more than a title with no meaning. Sophia knew the only reason he showed up this time was because his grandmother, Irene, faked an illness.
She'd daydreamed about their wedding night. But not once did she imagine it'd turn out like that—Easton's every move was harsh and fierce, fueled by bitterness, and her feelings didn't matter to him at all. She shut her eyes, tears streaming silently from the corners.
At the crack of dawn, the air in the bedroom was still thick with lingering traces of passion. Just as Easton started to get up, his phone began vibrating.
He glanced at the caller ID and his tone shifted, a trace of anxiety slipping in. ""Stella, what's wrong? Don't cry. I'll be right there.""
Sophia instantly knew who he was talking to. She let out a bitter, dry chuckle. 'Turns out Easton can  | Chapter 1 Pregnant

""I agree to marry you."" Outside the city hall, Britney Santos stared at the already closed doors, pulled out her phone, and dialed a number.

Today was supposed to be the day she and Aaron Galloway got their marriage license.

But she'd waited from nine in the morning until five-thirty in the afternoon, ending up with over a dozen queue tickets clutched in her hand. Aaron never showed.

He was the one who'd suggested getting married, and he was the one who'd stood her up. This was already the third time he'd flaked on her.

Britney tossed the useless tickets into the trash, turned on her heel, and called her longtime rival, Fredrick Pollard.

She still remembered how, the first time she'd been ditched here, Fredrick had straight-up asked her to marry him instead. But she'd turned him down.

The second time played out the same way.

This morning, Fredrick messaged her about marriage again. And this time, she said yes.

Just a moment ago, she'd spotted a post in her social media feed. It was from Aaron's old flame, his crush.

In the photo, Aaron sat ramrod straight, meticulously slicing an apple, with the caption: [Whenever I need him, he's always there. That's true favoritism, the kind of confidence only he can give me.]

Britney let out a self-mocking smirk, gave it a casual like, and commented: [Locked in forever. Wishing you eternal bliss.]

To her surprise, her heart felt completely at peace.

In the past, she would've screenshot it immediately and confronted Aaron, demanding to know what the hell it meant. It would've sparked a huge fight. And it always ended with him slamming the door on his way out.

But now, she didn't even feel like getting angry. She was truly done with Aaron.

The voice on the other end snapped her back to reality. ""I'm on a business trip. I'll be back in a week. If you're still up for it, meet me at the city hall at nine.""

The name sounded strange, like it belonged to someone else.

“Yes,” I said, my voice steady even though my pulse wasn’t. “I want the divorce filed quietly. I don’t want my husband or his people knowing until everything’s finalized.”

Ricci gave me a long, measuring look, but he didn’t question me further. Instead, he slid the paperwork towards me.

Several minutes ago, I received a message at the auction-you should know who your husband is having an affair with.
There was a link beneath the sentence.
My stomach drops. I tapped it. The livestream loaded instantly. 
Lucas was there. My husband of six years. Undressed.
There was also a woman beneath him.
Olivia Parker. My best friend.

Unknown number. One message.
You deserve to know what your husband is really paying for.
I stared at the words longer than necessary, my pulse slowing instead of spiking. Messages like that were usually nothing. Blackmail attempts. Bored guests looking for drama. The k | I witnessed my best friend riding my husband's shaft on a live stream.
